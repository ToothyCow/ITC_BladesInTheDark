Charismatic professor, schemer, secret archfey
Kindly mask, slight hunch. Old man quaver, slow and encouraging, manipulative.

Secretly a rebel archfey, drawing the attention of the stars to mortal politics and drinking in the power.

Opportunities:
- Benefits from the status quo shifting, as long as he stays in the middle of the action.
- Revelry - Loves drama, new ideas, intellectual stimulation
- Ambitious - loves power, wants more
- Freedom - Needs to be independent

Pitfalls:
- Not altruistic or benevolent - scoffs at that
- Very likely to learn that the PCs have a Dreamcatcher, and will hate it. Will try to steal/destroy
