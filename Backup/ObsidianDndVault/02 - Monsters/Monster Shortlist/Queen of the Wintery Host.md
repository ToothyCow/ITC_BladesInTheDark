### Traits

**Ice Climb.** When climbing on ice, the Snow Queen has a climbing speed of 20 feet, and she can climb difficult surfaces made of ice and snow, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.  

**Icy Weapons.** The Snow Queen's weapon attacks are magical. When she hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 cold damage (included in the attack).  

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the Snow Queen fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.  

**Snowsight.** The Snow Queen can see through areas obscured by snowfall, sleet, rain, and other wintry precipitation without penalty.  

**Snow Walk.** The Snow Queen can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost her extra movement.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The Snow Queen makes two Claw or Ice Bolt attacks.  

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.  

**Ice Bolt.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage. The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.  

**Cold Snap (Recharge 5–6).** The Snow Queen causes the temperature around her to drop dramatically. Each creature within 30 feet of the Snow Queen must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw.  
- **Fail:** 42 (12d6) cold damage and suffers one level of exhaustion.  
- **Success:** Half damage, no exhaustion.  
- **Cold-immune creatures:** Don't suffer exhaustion even on failure.  
- **Fail by 5 or more:** Petrified in ice for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Fire damage grants advantage on this saving throw.

### Legendary Actions

The Snow Queen can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The Snow Queen regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.

- **Attack.** The Snow Queen makes a Claw or Ice Bolt attack.  
- **Move.** The Snow Queen moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.  
- **Snowblind.** One creature the Snow Queen can see within 120 feet of her must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded by swirling snow until the end of its next turn.  
- **Wintry Swirl (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature within 15 feet of the Snow Queen must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or gain vulnerability to cold damage until the end of its next turn. A creature with immunity to cold damage that fails instead loses its immunity but isn't vulnerable.
