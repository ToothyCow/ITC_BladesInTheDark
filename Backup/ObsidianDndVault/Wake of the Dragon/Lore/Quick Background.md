It is a time of changes - political, technological, magical
- Nearly 100 years ago, the Burning Hordes attacked the free peoples of [[Ariosa]], razing the country with dragonfire
- In desperation, the general deposed the monarchy, imposed martial law, and unified the land for war
- All seemed lost until magical research yielded powerful weaponry capable of rending dragon hide and decimating battlefields
- Nearly all the dragons were killed
- In the aftermath, factions vie for power, and rumors of dark cults lurk in the shadows
- Change is coming
