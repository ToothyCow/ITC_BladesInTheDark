	- Someone set a house fire, killed wife ("Lily") and whole family. Jared blames business partner.

- Entered [[Voxfell - Fey Frontier Town]]
	- You notice one of the guards casually place a hand on Kanto's back, then do a series of subtle hand signs. Nearly imperceptibly, Kanto stiffens, but does not change his attitude or speech
	- As you near the palace, the guard slams a black hood over Kanto's head, and together they dive forward into a trapdoor under an arch

- Went to [[Voxfell - Backstage]]
	- As soon as [[Jei Malva]] drops through the trapdoor, she feels her Patron’s power cut off, and goes into cardiac arrest
	- A regal Fey gently touches your shoulder - Jei has a vision of dancing for the Dreamers
- Spoke with [[Queen of the Starry Host]]
> 	- “Two shunned children, striving to grow beyond their families.”
> 	- “Two inheritors of power and glory, wrestling to define their legacy.”
> 	- “A survivor, desperate to breathe free again.”
> 	- “No wonder you caught the Spotlight.”

- High level: she wants to get them where they want to go, as long as they're willing to bring a Dreamcatcher along. However, negotiations are dramatic, and they never waste drama.
- Negotiation - Deal was reached
	- Party agreed to carry a dreamcatcher for a year and a day, and to advocate for the Fey claim to the land - partnership?
	- In exchange, Queen transporting party safely away from Ravens territory
	- Additionally - Kanto remitted into their care, with name and face destroyed
- After negotiation, the ball:
    - Jei: “Tell [[Chimess]] that if she sends any more of her little pets to spy on me, I will return their heads with apples in their mouths.”
        - Delighted to learn that Chimess didn't know she was here, and offered a letter of recommendation in exchange for telling her story in 7 taverns within 7 months. Jei agreed
    - Falafel: “You are playing a dangerous game, aren't you? Do you think you stand a chance, a lone sapling facing down a hurricane?”
    - Tao: “Now, you are an oddity - Dragonspawn without Draconic taint. Beware of the song of flame."
    - A Naiad speaks with Samantha: “You're one of the Murphisonian clan, are you not? Do you know Dorald? Do tell him that if he gets tired of tinkering with space and time, we would welcome more of his sculptures.”
- Interlude - Jei and [[Mine]] talk
	- Mine worried that he'll suffer if Jei gets out. Doesn't want to be left behind
- In the morning, party sent to the desert near Bekai, City of Wonders
