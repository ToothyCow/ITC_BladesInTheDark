Other ideas (source: reddit)

- Definitely have some Djinn casino owners with the biggest prize being a wish. How far would some gamblers go to win their wildest dreams?
- Desperate gamblers try to mug the characters for cash.
- Mirror the real Vegas by having an underground sewer network full of desperate homeless all with darkvision. They also know the way in and out of all the secret tunnels around town.
- Pawn shops full of great magic items sold to them by degenerate gamblers. Have the players buy something that someone is angry they had to sell and try to steal it back.
- A Fey willing to make a deal to impart luck on the players in exchange for some bizarre quest or a favor owed that won't be very fun to pay up.
- A brothel that casts charm and modify memory to make the john believe they had the time of their life with the most beautiful women they've ever met despite nothing happening but them getting fleeced. Have someone recount the wild night to the players to trigger the plot hook.
- Have someone witness a casino cheating a desperate person in need of cash to save a loved one and have to figure out how to make things right.
- And the most obvious of them all, Oceans 11 - either have them get pulled into a heist or be present when a complicated one is going down, getting them unwittingly caught up in some relative insanity.
