# Light Blindness

### 

**Category** defensive; 




When first exposed to bright light, the monster is [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] until the end of its next turn. After this exposure, light doesn't blind the monster again until after it spends 1 hour in darkness. However, as long as the monster is in an area of bright light, it's [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]].
