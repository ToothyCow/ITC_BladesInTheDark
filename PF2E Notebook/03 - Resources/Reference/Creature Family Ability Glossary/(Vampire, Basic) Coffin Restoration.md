# (Vampire, Basic) Coffin Restoration

### [[divine]][[void]]

**Category** defensive; 




Unlike other undead, a vampire isn't destroyed at 0 HP. Instead, it falls [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]]. If its body rests in its coffin for 1 hour, the vampire gains 1 HP, after which its fast healing begins to function normally.
