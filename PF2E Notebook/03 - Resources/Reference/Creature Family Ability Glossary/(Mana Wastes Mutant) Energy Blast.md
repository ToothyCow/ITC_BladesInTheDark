# (Mana Wastes Mutant) Energy Blast `pf2:2`

### [[primal]]

**Category** offensive; 




Choose an energy type; this ability gains that energy type as a trait. The mutant gains some sort of physical alteration to their shape that suggests how they trigger their energy blast, be it numerous pustules on their body, an extra limb, or an additional opening in their throat to exhale the blast as a breath weapon. Choose whether the mutant creates a 60-foot line of energy or a 30-foot cone of energy when they activate this ability. The energy deals 1d6 damage per level with a Reflex check save. The mutant can't use Energy Blast again for 1d4 rounds.
