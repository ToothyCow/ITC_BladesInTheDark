# (Zombie) Disgusting Pustules

### [[disease]]

**Category** defensive; 




The zombie is covered in pustules that rupture when it takes any piercing damage or any critical hit.

Adjacent creatures are hit with vile fluid, causing them to become [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]] unless they succeed at a Fortitude check save against the moderate spell DC for the zombie's level.
