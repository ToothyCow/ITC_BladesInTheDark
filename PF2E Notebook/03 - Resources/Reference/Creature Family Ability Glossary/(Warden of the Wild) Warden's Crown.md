# (Warden of the Wild) Warden's Crown

### 

**Category** interaction; 




A Warden of the Wild's horned crown commands respect from wild creatures. Wild creatures native to a warden's biome automatically improve their attitude toward it by one step (up to friendly) and typically do not take hostile actions towards each other while in the warden's presence.
