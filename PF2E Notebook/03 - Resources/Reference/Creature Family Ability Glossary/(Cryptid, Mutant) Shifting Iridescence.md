# (Cryptid, Mutant) Shifting Iridescence

### [[magical]]

**Category** offensive; 




Whenever the mutant cryptid takes energy damage to which it isn't resistant or immune, after taking the damage normally, it gains resistance 5 to that damage type. If it had a resistance to a different damage type from shifting iridescence, it replaces the old resistance with the new resistance. The resistance increases to 10 at 9th level and 15 at 17th level.
