# (Vampire, Strigoi Progenitor) Shadow Escape `pf2:0`

### 

**Category** defensive; 




**Trigger** The strigoi is reduced to 0 HP

* * *

**Effect** The strigoi uses Shadow Form. It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the strigoi is unaffected by further damage. Once the strigoi reaches its coffin, or if it hasn't done so within 2 hours, it automatically returns to its physical form, [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]].
