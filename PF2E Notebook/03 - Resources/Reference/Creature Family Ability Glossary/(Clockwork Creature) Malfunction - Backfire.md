# (Clockwork Creature) Malfunction - Backfire

### 

**Category** offensive; 




The clockwork rolls a DC 5 Flat check at the start of each of its turns. On a failure, it backfires, dealing 2d6 fire damage in a 15-foot cone, including to itself (DC 0 Reflex check save at the standard DC for its level), and is [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]] this turn.
