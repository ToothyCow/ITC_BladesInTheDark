# (Skeleton) Bone Powder

### 

**Category** defensive; 




When the skeleton takes physical damage from a critical hit, one of its bones is pulverized into a fine powder.

All creatures in a 5-foot emanation that breathe take 1d6 persistent poison damage (plus an additional 1d6 for every 6 levels the skeleton has).
