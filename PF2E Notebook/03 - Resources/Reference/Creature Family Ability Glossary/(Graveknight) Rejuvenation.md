# (Graveknight) Rejuvenation

### [[divine]]

**Category** defensive; 




When a graveknight is destroyed, their armor rebuilds their body over the course of 1d10 days—or more quickly if the armor is worn by a living host. If the body is destroyed before then, the process restarts.

A graveknight can only be permanently destroyed by obliterating their armor (such as with [[Spells/Disintegrate|Disintegrate]]), transporting it to the Forge of Creation, or throwing it into the heart of a volcano.
