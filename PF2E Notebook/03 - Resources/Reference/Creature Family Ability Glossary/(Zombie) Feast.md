# (Zombie) Feast `pf2:2`

### [[manipulate]]

**Category** offensive; 




If the zombie is adjacent to a [[Conditions/Restrained|Restrained]] or [[Conditions/Unconscious|Unconscious]] creature, or a corpse that died in the past hour, the zombie can feast upon its flesh to heal itself.

This restores an amount of Hit Points equal to the zombie's level. If the creature is alive, the zombie deals damage equal to its jaws, fist, or claw damage.
