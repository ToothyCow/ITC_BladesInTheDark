# (Skeleton) Crumbling Bones

### 






The skeleton is made from crumbling bones that drift in clouds of dust. The skeleton has a fly Speed of 20 but it must end its turn within no more than 5 feet off the ground, or it falls, taking damage as normal. In addition, the skeleton can move through any space that's large enough for its skull to fit through.
