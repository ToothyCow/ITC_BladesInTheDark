# (Vampire, True) Children of the Night

### [[divine]][[mental]]

**Category** interaction; 




The vampire's presence brings forth creatures of the night to do the master's bidding. These typically include [[Monster Core/Rat Swarm|Rat Swarms]], [[Monster Core/Vampire Bat Swarm|Bat Swarms]], and [[Monster Core/Wolf|Wolves]], but can include other creatures.

The vampire can give telepathic orders to these creatures as long as they are within 100 feet, but they can't communicate back.
