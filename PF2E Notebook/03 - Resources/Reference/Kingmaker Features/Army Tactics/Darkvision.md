# Darkvision
## Item 1
### [[cavalry]][[infantry]][[siege]][[skirmisher]]

**Category** army-tactic; 




The army includes several spotters and scouts who have darkvision, and the rest of the soldiers have been trained to follow their lead so that the army itself functions as if it had darkvision.
