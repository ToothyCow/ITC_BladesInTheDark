# Perform `pf2:1`

### [[concentrate]][[skill]]

**Category** interaction; 




When making a brief performance-one song, a quick dance, or a few jokes-you use the Perform action. This action is most useful when you want to prove your capability or impress someone quickly. Performing rarely has an impact on its own, but it might influence the DCs of subsequent Diplomacy checks against the observers, or even change their attitudes if the GM sees fit.
