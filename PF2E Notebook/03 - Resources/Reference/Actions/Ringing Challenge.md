# Ringing Challenge `pf2:1`

### [[sonic]][[spirit]][[transcendence]]






You clang your ikon against a weapon, shield, or the ground, emitting a shock wave that deals 1d4 spirit + 1d4 sonic damage to all creatures in a 30-foot cone or 15-foot emanation (Fortitude check save). A creature that critically fails its saving throw is [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]] for 1 minute.

At 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the damage increases by 1d4 spirit damage and 1d4 sonic damage.
