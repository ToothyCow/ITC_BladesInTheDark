# One Moment till Glory `pf2:1`

### [[concentrate]][[emotion]][[mental]][[transcendence]]






You rally your allies, carrying them from the brink of disaster to the verge of victory. Each ally in your aura can immediately attempt a new saving throw with a +2 status bonus against one ongoing negative effect or condition currently affecting them, even if that effect would not normally allow a new saving throw.
