# Unfriendly

### 

**Group** attitudes




This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose this condition on a PC. A creature that is unfriendly to a character dislikes and distrusts that character. The unfriendly creature won't accept [[Actions/Request|Requests]] from the character.
