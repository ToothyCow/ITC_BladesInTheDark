# Eliminate Red Herrings
## Feat 1
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




You have a keen sense for avoiding spurious lines of inquiry. When you roll a critical failure on a skill check to Recall Knowledge related to a question about one of your active investigations, you get a failure instead.
