# Eyes Unclouded
## Feat 18
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ascended Celestial Dedication
* * *
Your senses are enhanced by your divine spark, enabling you see things as they truly are, piercing through illusions, transformations, and lies. You're affected by a constant truesight spell. Additionally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to [[Actions/Sense Motive|Sense Motive]] and to Perception DCs against attempts to Lie to you. When a creature attempts to Lie to you, they roll the Deception check to Lie twice and use the worse result; this is a misfortune effect.
