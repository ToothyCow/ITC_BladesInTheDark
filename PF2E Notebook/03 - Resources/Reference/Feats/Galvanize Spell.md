# Galvanize Spell `pf2:0`
## Feat 18
### [[concentrate]][[mythic]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Wildspell Dedication
* * *
**Frequency** once per day

**Requirements** Your spellsurge aura is active.

* * *

You reabsorb the magic of your spellsurge aura to power a piece of powerful magic. Spend a Mythic Point. Your spellsurge ends. If your next action is to Cast a Spell that's at least 2 ranks lower than the highest spell slot you have, you reduce the number of actions to cast it by 1 (minimum 1 action). You then immediately regain the ability to cast that spell again (with the normal parameters) or the spell slot used.
