# Talismanic Sage
## Feat 14
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Talisman Dabbler Dedication
* * *
Normally, affixing more than one talisman to an item causes the talismans to be suppressed, but when you Affix a Talisman, you can specially treat one item you're working on, allowing it to have two active talismans at once. This special treatment ends if you use [[Actions/Affix a Talisman|Affix a Talisman]] to treat a new item for this ability.
