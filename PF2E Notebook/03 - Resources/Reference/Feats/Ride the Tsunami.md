# Ride the Tsunami `pf2:3`
## Feat 18
### [[impulse]][[kineticist]][[overflow]][[primal]][[water]]

**Category** class; 




Booming, crashing walls of water, enough to fill a harbor, smash out ahead of you, overwhelming all in their path. The waves move forward in your choice of a 60-foot cone or 120-foot line. If you're in water, you can increase these waves to a 90-foot cone or 180-foot line. Each creature in the area takes 10d10 bludgeoning damage with a Reflex check save against your class DC. A creature that fails its save is pushed 20 feet (or 40 feet on a critical failure). Any unattended object of 1 Bulk or less in the area is pushed to the far edge of the area. The sheer mass of water extinguishes all non-magical flames in the area.

As the wave crashes down, you can catch it to your destination. After the impulse deals damage, you can Swim in a straight line to any point in its area before the water disappears.
