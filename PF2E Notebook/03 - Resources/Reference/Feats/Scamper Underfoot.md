# Scamper Underfoot
## Feat 1
### [[shoony]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You are used to ducking under foes and can scurry around the battlefield with ease. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to [[Actions/Tumble Through|Tumble Through]] the spaces of Medium or larger enemies, and the presence of an enemy doesn't make the squares difficult terrain.
