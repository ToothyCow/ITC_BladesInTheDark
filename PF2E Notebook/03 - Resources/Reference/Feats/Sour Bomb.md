# Sour Bomb
## Feat 10
### [[additive]][[alchemist]][[olfactory]]

**Category** class; 




You can mix ingredients with a powerful sour smell into an alchemical bomb to make its explosion an overpowering stench. Any creature hit by the bomb must attempt a Fortitude check save against your class DC in addition to the bomb's normal effects.

**Success** The creature is unaffected beyond a strong craving for pickles.

**Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 1]].

**Critical Failure** The creature is [[Conditions/Sickened|Sickened 2]], and [[Conditions/Fleeing|Fleeing]] for 1 round from the smell.
