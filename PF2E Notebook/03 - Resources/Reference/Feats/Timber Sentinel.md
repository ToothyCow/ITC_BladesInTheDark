# Timber Sentinel `pf2:2`
## Feat 1
### [[impulse]][[kineticist]][[plant]][[primal]][[wood]]

**Category** class; 




A slim, symmetrical tree travels from the Plane of Wood. You conjure a tree within 30 feet, as a [[Spells/Protector Tree|Protector Tree]] spell of a rank equal to half your level rounded up. If you use this impulse again, any previous one ends, and an ordinary tree remains.
