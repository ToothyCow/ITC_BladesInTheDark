# Twin Takedown `pf2:1`
## Feat 1
### [[flourish]][[ranger]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wielding two melee weapons, each in a different hand.

* * *

You swiftly attack your hunted prey with each of your weapons, potentially combining their damage into a single devastating attack. Make two Strikes against your hunted prey, one with each of the required weapons. If both hit the same hunted prey, combine their damage for the purpose of its resistances and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to each Strike normally.
