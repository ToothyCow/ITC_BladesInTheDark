## Feat 20
### [[monk]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Master of Many Styles

You flow from technique to technique, renewing yourself as you embrace each style you have mastered. The first time each round that you use an action that has both the monk and stance traits, you gain 20 temporary Hit Points that last until the start of your next turn.
