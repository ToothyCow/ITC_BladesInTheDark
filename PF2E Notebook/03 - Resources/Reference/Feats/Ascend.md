# Ascend
## Feat 14
### [[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ascended Celestial Dedication
* * *
As you strive to ascend to the ranks of celestials, the pull of gravity loosens on your body. You gain a fly Speed equal to your land Speed and the [[Actions/Flyby Attack|Flyby Attack]] action. When you gain this feat, you can choose to sprout wings, if desired; these wings are permanent.

Once per day as a single action, you can fly at incredible speeds. When you do, your fly Speed becomes equal to double your Speed for 5 rounds.
