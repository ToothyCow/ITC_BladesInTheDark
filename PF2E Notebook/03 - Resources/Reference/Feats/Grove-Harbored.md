### [[ardande]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You are accustomed to exploring thick woodlands and defending yourself against the attacks of magical plants. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saves against plant, poison, and wood effects, and if you roll a success on a save against a poison effect, you get a critical success instead.
