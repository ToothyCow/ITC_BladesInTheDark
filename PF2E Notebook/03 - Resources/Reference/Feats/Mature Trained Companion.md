# Mature Trained Companion
## Feat 6
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Animal Trainer Dedication 
* * *
Your animal companion grows up, becoming a mature animal companion. Increase its proficiency rank in Performance to expert instead of one of the three skill increases for mature. It gains the [[Adventure-Specific Actions/Mesmerizing Performance|Mesmerizing Performance]] advanced maneuver, rather than the normal advanced maneuver for its type.
