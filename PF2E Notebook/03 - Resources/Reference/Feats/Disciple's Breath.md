**Prerequisites** Dragon Disciple Dedication; dragon breath sorcerer bloodline spell

You unleash your breath weapon without spending focus. This has the effects of your Dragon Breath sorcerer bloodline spell, though it deals 9d6 damage instead of its usual damage, and you don't have to cast it or spend a Focus Point. You can't use Disciple's Breath again for 1d4 rounds.
