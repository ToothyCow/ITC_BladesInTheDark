## Feat 2
### [[general]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Medicine

You zealously monitor a patient's progress to administer treatment faster. When you [[Actions/Treat Wounds|Treat Wounds]], your patient becomes immune for only 10 minutes instead of 1 hour. This applies only to your Treat Wounds activities, not any other the patient receives.
