# Mountain's Stoutness
## Feat 9
### [[dwarf]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your hardiness lets you withstand more punishment than most. Increase your maximum Hit Points by your level. When you have the [[Conditions/Dying|Dying 1]] condition, the DC of your recovery checks is equal to 9 + your dying value (instead of 10 + your dying value).

If you also have the [[Feats/Toughness|Toughness]] feat, the Hit Points gained from it and this feat are cumulative, and the DC of your recovery checks is equal to 6 + your dying value.
