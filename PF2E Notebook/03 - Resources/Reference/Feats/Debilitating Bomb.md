# Debilitating Bomb
## Feat 6
### [[additive2]][[alchemist]]

**Category** class; 




You can add a crystalline additive to an alchemical bomb to have it undermine your enemy. Choose [[Conditions/Dazzled|Dazzled]], [[Conditions/Deafened|Deafened]], [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]], or a –5-foot status penalty to Speeds. If the attack with the bomb hits, in addition to the bomb's normal effects, the target must succeed at a Fortitude check saving throw or take that effect until the start of your next turn. Use your class DC for this saving throw, even if someone else throws the bomb.
