# Draconic Veil
## Feat 13
### [[dragonblood]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Like some dragons, your forebear had the supernatural ability to change their shape to walk among humanoids. You have learned how to mimic this ability. You can cast [[Spells/Humanoid Form|Humanoid Form]] as a 5th-rank innate spell once per day, except that the duration is increased to 1 hour. The spell's tradition matches your draconic exemplar's.
