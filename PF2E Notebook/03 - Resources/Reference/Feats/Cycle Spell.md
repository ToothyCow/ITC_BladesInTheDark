# Cycle Spell
## Feat 4
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Soul Warden Dedication
* * *
Your devotion to the cycle of souls grants you an additional divine spell. Choose from [[Spells/Bless|Bless]], [[Spells/Infuse Vitality|Infuse Vitality]], or [[Spells/Heal|Heal]]. You must make this selection when you take this feat and it can't be changed. Once per day, while your spiral is glowing, you can cast the selected spell as a divine innate spell.
