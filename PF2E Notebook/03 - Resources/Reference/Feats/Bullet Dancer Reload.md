# Bullet Dancer Reload `pf2:1`
## Feat 10
### [[archetype]][[flourish]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Bullet Dancer Burn
* * *
**Requirements** You're in Bullet Dancer Stance.

* * *

You've learned to reload your simple firearms with uncanny grace, the ammunition simply falling into place as though part of a well-practiced kata. You Strike with a simple firearm, and then Interact to reload that same firearm. You don't need a free hand to reload your simple firearm in this way.
