# Pistol Twirl `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[gunslinger]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Deception
* * *
**Requirements** You're wielding a loaded one-handed ranged weapon.

* * *

Your quick gestures and flair for performance distract your opponent, leaving it vulnerable to your follow-up attacks. You [[Actions/Feint|Feint]] against an opponent within the required weapon's first range increment, rather than an opponent within melee reach. If you succeed, the foe is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] against your melee and ranged attacks, rather than only your melee attacks. On a critical failure, you're off-guard against the target's melee and ranged attacks, rather than only its melee attacks.
