# Shared Stratagem
## Feat 2
### [[investigator]]

**Category** class; 




The plans you make include your allies as well as yourself. When you hit a creature with an attack on which you substituted your attack roll due to Devising a Stratagem, designate one ally. The creature you hit is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to that ally on the next attack that ally makes against that creature before the start of your next turn.
