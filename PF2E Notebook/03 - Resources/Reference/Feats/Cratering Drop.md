### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Winged Warrior Dedication; Pluck from the Sky
* * *
**Requirements** Your previous action was Pluck from the Sky, and the target failed or critically failed their saving throw.

You follow up your enemy's fall, driving you both to the earth in a meteoric descent. You Fly straight down, increasing the amount the enemy falls by your Fly speed. If you reach the ground, you drive the enemy into the ground, dealing double the normal falling damage.
