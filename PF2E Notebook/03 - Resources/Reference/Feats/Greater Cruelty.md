# Greater Cruelty
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Cruelty
* * *
The extent of your corruption devastates your foes' minds and reflexes. When you use [[Feats/Cruelty|Cruelty]], you can choose to make the target [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]] or [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied]] instead, with the same condition value. Make the choice when you Cast the Spell (before you know the result of the target's save)
