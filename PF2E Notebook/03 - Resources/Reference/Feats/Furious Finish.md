# Furious Finish `pf2:1`
## Feat 2
### [[barbarian]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 




Desperate to finish the fight, you pour all your rage into one final blow. Make a Strike. If it hits, you gain a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of rounds remaining in your Rage (maximum 10). After this Strike, your Rage immediately ends, and you are [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] until you rest for at least 10 minutes.
