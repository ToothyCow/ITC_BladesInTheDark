# Scurry! `pf2:0`
## Feat 5
### [[awakened-animal]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Tiny size
* * *
**Trigger** You roll initiative.

* * *

Your instincts to move to safety are strong. You Stride; you must end your movement in a location where you have cover from at least one enemy you can see, and you can't take this action if it's impossible for you to do so. You can Climb, Fly, or Swim instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.
