# Forced Entry
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[skill]]

**Category** skill; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Athletics; Pathfinder Agent Dedication
* * *
You are trained to preserve the archaeological value of your location when entering. You don't take a penalty to [[Actions/Force Open|Force Open]] doors, windows, or containers without a crowbar. If you roll a success on a check to Force Open, you get a critical success instead.
