# Unending Subsistence `pf2:1`
## Feat 4
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 




Your mythic power allows you to take a small amount of food and replicate it near endlessly. When you attempt a Society or Survival check to [[Actions/Subsist|Subsist]], you can spend a Mythic Point to attempt the check at mythic proficiency. Succeeding at the check always provides enough food and shelter for you and up to a dozen other creatures. On a critical success, all creatures you obtain food and shelter for gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saving throws for the next 24 hours.
