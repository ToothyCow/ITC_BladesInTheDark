# Sidestep `pf2:r`
## Feat 8
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 




**Trigger** The attack roll for a Strike targeting you fails or critically fails.

* * *

You deftly step out of the way of an attack, letting the blow continue. You redirect the attack to a creature of your choice that is adjacent to you and within the reach of the triggering attack. The attacker rerolls the Strike's attack roll against the new target.
