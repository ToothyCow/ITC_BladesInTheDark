# Chosen Ward
## Feat 14
### [[mythic]]

**Category** classfeature; 



**Prerequisites** Beast Lord Dedication
* * *
You have designated an ally to be you and your companion's ward, making it your primary directive to shield them from harm. During your daily preparations, choose an ally who isn't your united companion. While either you or your united companion are adjacent to your ward, you grant them a +1 circumstance bonus to their AC and Reflex saves.

When your ward attempts a Reflex saving throw while adjacent to either you or your united companion, you can spend a Mythic Point as a reaction to allow your ward to roll that Reflex save twice and take the better result. This is a fortune effect.

* * *

**Special** If you have the Defend Our Union feat, it can also be triggered when a foe successfully Strikes your ward; if used in this way, the damage to your ward is reduced if your Strike is successful instead.
