# Undying Beast
## Feat 12
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Werecreature Dedication
* * *
You can be injured by non-silver sources but recover with staggering speed. When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points by non-silver damage and don't immediately die from a death effect or a high dying value, you stabilize immediately afterward. You gain the wounded condition as normal.
