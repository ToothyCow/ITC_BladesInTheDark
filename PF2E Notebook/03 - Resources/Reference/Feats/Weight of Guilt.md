# Weight of Guilt
## Feat 1
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** redemption cause
* * *
Guilt clouds the minds of those who ignore your [[Actions/Glimpse of Redemption|Glimpse of Redemption]]. Instead of making the triggering creature enfeebled 2, you can make it [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for the same duration.
