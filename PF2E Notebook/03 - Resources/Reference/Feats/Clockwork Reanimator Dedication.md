# Clockwork Reanimator Dedication
## Feat 2
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[dedication]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** trained in Crafting
* * *
You can animate corpses through cunning engineering. You gain a prototype construct companion to serve as a minion. Unlike normal construct companions, yours is a corpse animated by clockwork gears and technological prowess.

**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the [[PF2e Journals/Archetypes/Clockwork Reanimator|Clockwork Reanimator]] archetype. If you retrain out of this feat, you lose the rituals learned from it.
