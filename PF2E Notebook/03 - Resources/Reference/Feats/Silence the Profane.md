**Trigger** A creature you can observe within your reach, or within your weapon's first range increment if you are wielding a ranged weapon, casts a divine spell.

Your training included instruction on how to prevent enemy priests from using their magic against you, a technique you have now mastered. Make a Strike with the required weapon against the opponent; if the Strike is successful, the triggering spell is disrupted and the target is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] for 1 round.
