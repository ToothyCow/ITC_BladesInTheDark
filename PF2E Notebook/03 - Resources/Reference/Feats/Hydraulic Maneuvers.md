# Hydraulic Maneuvers `pf2:1`
## Feat 13
### [[azarketi]][[concentrate]][[manipulate]][[primal]][[water]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You batter your foes with a torrent of water siphoned from your surroundings.

If the next action you take is an Athletics check to [[Actions/Disarm|Disarm]], [[Actions/Shove|Shove]], or [[Actions/Trip|Trip]], that action has a range of 15 feet. You don't receive any item bonuses to that check or any circumstance bonuses related to your physical body, but if you roll a critical failure on that Athletics check, you get a failure instead.
