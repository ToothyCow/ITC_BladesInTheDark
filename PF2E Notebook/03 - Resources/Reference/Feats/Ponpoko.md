# Ponpoko
## Feat 5
### [[tanuki]]

**Category** ancestry; 




No true tanuki would ever be caught without a musical instrument to play under the full moon. You can attempt Performance checks and cast spells by drumming on your belly; this requires that you have at least one hand free, and like playing an instrument, it grants the [[Actions/Perform|Perform]] action the auditory and manipulate traits. When Casting a Spell, your gestures can include drumming your belly. If you do, any attempt to recognize a spell cast this way gains a -2 circumstance penalty.
