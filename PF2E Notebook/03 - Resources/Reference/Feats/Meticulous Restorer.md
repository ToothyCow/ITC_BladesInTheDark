## Feat 1
### [[yaksha]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Waste not, want not; your steady eye allows you to restore craftwork quickly while conserving valuable material. You gain the Quick Repair feat. In addition, when you roll a critical failure while attempting to Repair an item, you get a failure instead.
