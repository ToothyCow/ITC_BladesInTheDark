# Follow-Up Assault `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[barbarian]][[rage]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You used your previous action to make a melee Strike that missed.

Even in the face of failure you press the attack, determined to succeed. Make a Strike with the same weapon, adding the backswing and forceful weapon traits to that Strike.
