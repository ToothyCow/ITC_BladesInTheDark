# Worm Empathy
## Feat 8
### [[archetype]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Worm Caller Dedication
* * *
You can connect with cave worms (and other worm-related creatures, at the GM's discretion) on a rudimentary level. You can use Diplomacy to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] on cave worms and to make simple Requests of them. In most cases, the cave worm's starting attitude is indifferent and they will give you time to establish contact.
