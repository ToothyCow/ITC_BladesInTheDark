# Paragon's Guard `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [[fighter]][[stance]]

**Category** class; 




**Requirements** You are wielding a shield.

* * *

Once you've had a moment to set your stance, you always have your shield ready without a thought. While you are in this stance, you constantly have your shield raised as if you'd used the [[Actions/Raise a Shield|Raise a Shield]] action.
