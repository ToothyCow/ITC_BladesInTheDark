# Mythic Refocus
## Feat 8
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** You have a focus pool.
* * *
As your ability to control your mythic power grows, you learn to channel it to restore and reinforce other forms of power at your command. Spend a Mythic Point; you immediately recover all your Focus Points, filling your focus pool to its current maximum.
