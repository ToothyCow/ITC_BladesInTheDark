# Grimspawn
## Feat 1
### [[lineage]][[nephilim]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your lineage traces back to a daemon, one of the manifestations of horrific forms of death that devour souls within their foul home of Abaddon. As a result, you cling tenaciously to the last shreds of your own life force. You gain the [[Feats/Diehard|Diehard]] general feat.
