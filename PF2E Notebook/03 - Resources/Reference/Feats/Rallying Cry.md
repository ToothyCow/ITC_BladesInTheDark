You call out to your allies and push them to give their all in combat. All allies in a 30-foot emanation that can hear you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level. In addition, these allies become [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]] for 1 minute but can use the extra action only to Step, Stride, or Strike.
