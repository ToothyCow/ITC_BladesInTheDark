# Steady Spellcasting (Magus)
## Feat 4
### [[magus]]

**Category** class; 




Confident in your technique, you don't easily lose your concentration when you Cast a Spell.

If a reaction would disrupt your spellcasting action, attempt a DC 15 Flat check check. If you succeed, your action isn't disrupted.
