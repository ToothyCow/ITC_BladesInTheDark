# Ritual Reversion
## Feat 5
### [[leshy]][[polymorph]][[primal]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You can temporarily revert to a less conspicuous form without diminishing your senses. You take the form of an ordinary specimen of the type of plant or fungus that most closely resembles you, reverting to your body's appearance just before your spirit joined with it. This otherwise has the effects of [[Spells/One with Plants|One with Plants]], except that your size remains Small.
