# Cleansing Transformation
## Feat 14
### [[druid]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Healing Transformation
* * *
You learn to cleanse bodily toxins alongside the transformations of your shape-changing magic. When you use Healing Transformation, your polymorph spell can also attempt to counteract one disease or poison afflicting the target. If you don't successfully counteract it, you can't use Cleansing Transformation against that specific affliction for 24 hours.
