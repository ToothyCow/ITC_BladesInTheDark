# Emotional Partitions
## Feat 1
### [[kashrishi]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have created strong mental partitions in your mind to filter out negative emotional influences. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against emotion effects. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a critical success instead.
