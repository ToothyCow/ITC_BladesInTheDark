It's said that the flesh of the right side of a hyena can heal diseases, but that the flesh of the left side is deadly and poisonous. You deal 1 slashing damage to yourself to poison a weapon you are holding. If you hit with the weapon and deal damage, the target also takes 1d4 persistent poison damage. The poison on your weapon becomes inert after you hit, or at the end of your next turn, whichever comes first.
