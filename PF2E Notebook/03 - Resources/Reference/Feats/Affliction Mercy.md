# Affliction Mercy
## Feat 12
### [[champion]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Mercy
* * *
The divine grace that flows through you grants reprieve from an affliction. Add mercy of recuperation to the types of [[Feats/Mercy|Mercy]] you can provide, allowing you to counteract an affliction instead of an effect causing a condition (typically an affliction is a curse, disease, or poison).
