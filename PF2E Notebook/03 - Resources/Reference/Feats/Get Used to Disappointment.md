# Get Used to Disappointment `pf2:0`
## Feat 12
### [[bravado]][[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** expert in Intimidation
* * *
**Requirements** Your turn begins, and one target within 30 feet failed an attack roll or skill check against you on its last turn.

* * *

You capitalize on an opponent's failure with smug attitude and swagger, reminding them of the gap in skill between you and your opponent. You attempt to [[/act demoralize options=item:trait:bravado]] the opponent. Regardless of the result, the target becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.
