**Category** class; 




**Trigger** A creature you can see targets you with an attack.

**Requirements** You aren't encumbered.

You deftly dodge out of the way, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. If the Strike misses, you gain panache until the end of your next turn
