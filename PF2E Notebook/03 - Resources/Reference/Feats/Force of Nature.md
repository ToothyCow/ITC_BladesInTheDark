# Force of Nature
## Feat 16
### [[archetype]][[healing]][[primal]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Werecreature Dedication
* * *
You're a nigh-unstoppable killing machine, with only silver able to quell your rampage. When in hybrid or animal shape, you gain fast healing 5. If you take damage from a silver weapon, your fast healing deactivates until the end of your next turn.
