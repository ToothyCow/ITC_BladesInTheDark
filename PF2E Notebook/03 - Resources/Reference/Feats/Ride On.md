# Ride On `pf2:r`
## Feat 9
### [[centaur]]

**Category** ancestry; 




**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You would gain the [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] condition.

* * *

Even when tired, you refuse to give up, pushing yourself to extreme feats of endurance. You delay the effects of the fatigued condition for 3 rounds. If the fatigued condition has a duration, the duration begins to elapse only after the delay. You can't further delay or prevent the fatigued condition after this ability ends.
