# Precise Finisher
## Feat 6
### [[swashbuckler]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Confident Finisher
* * *
Even when your foe avoids your [[Actions/Confident Finisher|Confident Finisher]], you can still hit a vital spot. On a failure with Confident Finisher, you apply your full precise strike damage instead of half.
