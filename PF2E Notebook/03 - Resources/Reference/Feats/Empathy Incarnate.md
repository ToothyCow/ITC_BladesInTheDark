# Empathy Incarnate
## Feat 5
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[reincarnated]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Reincarnation has given you a compassionate perspective and enabled you to relate to almost everyone you speak with, putting them at ease and quickly generating trust. Whenever you attempt a Diplomacy check to [[Actions/Make an Impression|Make an Impression]] or [[Actions/Request|Request]] something, the DC is reduced by 2, and if the creature you're speaking with is lower level than you, any success is a critical success. Whenever you attempt a Diplomacy check to [[Actions/Gather Information|Gather Information]], you can't critically fail.
