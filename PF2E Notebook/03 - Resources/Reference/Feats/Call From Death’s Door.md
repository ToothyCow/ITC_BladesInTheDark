# Call From Death’s Door `pf2:r`
## Feat 10
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Caretaker’s Calling
* * *
**Trigger** The dying condition of an ally you're observing would increase.

* * *

Even death halts in the face of your power. Spend a Mythic Point; the triggering ally loses the dying condition, their wounded condition doesn't increase, and they heal a number of Hit Points equal to twice your level.
