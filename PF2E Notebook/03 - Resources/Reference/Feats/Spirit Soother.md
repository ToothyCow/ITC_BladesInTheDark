# Spirit Soother
## Feat 5
### [[duskwalker]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You are attuned to the minute sounds and sensations of restless spirits. Even if you aren't [[Actions/Search|Searching]], you can attempt a check to find haunts that normally require you to be Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the haunt. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to disable haunts.
