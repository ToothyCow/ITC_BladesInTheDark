# Celestial Armaments
## Feat 16
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[mythic]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Ascended Celestial Dedication
* * *
You imbue a fragment of your divine spark into a weapon, blessing your blade and transforming it into a weapon worthy of the celestial realms. Select one weapon or handwraps of mighty blows when you make your daily preparations. The weapon sheds light like a torch, deals an additional 1d8 spirit damage, and creatures who wield it gain the weapon's critical specialization.

When you critically hit a target with the weapon, the target must succeed at a Fortitude check save against your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher) or be [[Conditions/Blinded|Blinded]] for [[/gmr 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.

As a single action that has the concentration trait, you can hold your hand aloft and call this weapon back to your possession; it immediately teleports into your hand.

While you're holding this weapon, you can spend 1 Mythic Point as a single action to temporarily grant a blessing to weapons wielded by your allies. Each ally within the bright light of your nimbus when you take this action selects one weapon in their possession. For 1 minute, the selected weapons gain the following benefits: the weapon sheds light like a torch, the weapon deals an additional 1d6 spirit damage, and creatures who wield the weapon gain the weapon's critical specialization.
