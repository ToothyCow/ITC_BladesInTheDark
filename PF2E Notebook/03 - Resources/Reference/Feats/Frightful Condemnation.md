# Frightful Condemnation `pf2:0`
## Feat 6
### [[archetype]][[emotion]][[fear]][[mental]][[vigilante]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Vigilante Dedication; Member of the Grey Gardeners; Harsh Judgement
* * *
**Trigger** You hit your condemned foe with a melee Strike in the same turn during which you condemned it with Harsh Judgment.

**Requirements** You have condemned a foe to death with Harsh Judgment.

* * *

Your willingness to follow through on your pitiless judgment is frightful to the person you have condemned, and they begin to dread what you will do to them next. Your condemned foe is [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 1]], or [[Conditions/Frightened|Frightened 2]] if the triggering Strike was a critical hit.
