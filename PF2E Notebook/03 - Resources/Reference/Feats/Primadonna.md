# Primadonna `pf2:1`
## Feat 12
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[archetype]][[auditory]][[visual]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Celebrity Dedication; master in Performance
* * *
**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

The spotlight should always be on you and you alone. Attempt a @check\[performance|defense:will\] check against the Will DCs of all enemies within 30 feet who can see or hear you. On a success, the targets focus on you and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to hit you, but they're [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] to all creatures other than yourself. On a critical success, the effect lasts for 3 rounds.
