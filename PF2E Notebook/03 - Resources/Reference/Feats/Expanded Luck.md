# Expanded Luck
## Feat 5
### [[catfolk]]

**Category** ancestry; 



**Prerequisites** Cat's Luck
* * *
You are luckier even than most catfolk. You can trigger [[Feats/Cat's Luck|Cat's Luck]] when you fail or critically fail a Fortitude or Will saving throw in addition to Reflex saving throws.

You still can use Cat's Luck only once per day.
