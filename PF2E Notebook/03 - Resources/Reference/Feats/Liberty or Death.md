# Liberty or Death `pf2:2`
## Feat 18
### [[death]][[incapacitation]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Broken Chain Dedication
* * *
**Requirements** A creature has been the target of your Ultimatum of Liberation for at least 1 minute

* * *

You have given a despot enough time to think, and now is the time for them to forfeit their control or die. Spend a Mythic Point and make a Strike at mythic proficiency against the required creature. If you succeed and deal damage, the target must succeed on a Fortitude check save against your class DC or spell DC (whichever is higher) or die. If the target succeeds, they are immune to this ability for 24 hours.
