**Prerequisites** Untamed Form

The forms you take on defy belief-chimerical sights of twisted antlers or acidic drool. If your next action is to cast [[Spells/Untamed Form|Untamed Form]], you can change the damage type of a single unarmed attack granted by the _untamed form_ form to one of the following: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, poison, piercing, or slashing. The chosen attack gains the appropriate trait.
