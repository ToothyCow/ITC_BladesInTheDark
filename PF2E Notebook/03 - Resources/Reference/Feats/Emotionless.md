# Emotionless
## Feat 1
### [[android]]

**Category** ancestry; 




Your malfunctioning emotional processors make it difficult for you to feel strong emotions. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against emotion and fear effects. If you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion or fear effect, you get a critical success instead.
