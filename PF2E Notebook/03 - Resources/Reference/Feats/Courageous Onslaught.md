You use your performance to orchestrate an onslaught against your enemies. If your next action is to cast the [[Spells/Courageous Anthem|Courageous Anthem]] composition cantrip, one ally of your choice who gains a status bonus from the spell can immediately use their reaction to Stride and then make a melee Strike.
