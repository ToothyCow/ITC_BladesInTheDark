# Hag Claws
## Feat 1
### [[changeling]]

**Category** ancestry; 




When you came of age, your fingernails grew long and sharp. You gain a claw unarmed attack that deals 1d4 slashing damage. Your claws are in the brawling group and have the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.

* * *

**Special** Hag claws can develop at any point in a changeling's life. You can select this feat anytime you would gain an ancestry feat, but you can't retrain out of it.
