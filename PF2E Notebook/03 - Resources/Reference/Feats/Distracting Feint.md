# Distracting Feint
## Feat 2
### [[rogue]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** scoundrel racket
* * *
Your [[Actions/Feint|Feints]] are far more distracting than normal. While a creature is [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] by your [[Actions/Feint|Feint]], it also takes a –2 circumstance penalty to Perception checks and Reflex saves.
