# Bamboo and Silt Repose
## Feat 1
### [[yaksha]]

**Category** ancestry; 




At home among mire and copse, you flit from river to tree with a dragonfly's shimmering grace. You ignore non-magical difficult terrain due to light undergrowth and shallow bogs, mud, and water, and you treat non-magical greater difficult terrain due to these features as difficult terrain instead.
