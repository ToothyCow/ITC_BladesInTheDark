# Apparition's Reflection `pf2:1`
## Feat 8
### [[animist]][[apparition]][[spellshape]]

**Category** class; 




**Frequency** once per hour

* * *

Your apparition infuses your body with additional power. You regain one expended apparition spell slot that is at least 2 ranks lower than your highest-rank spell slot and takes 1, 2, or 3 actions to Cast. You then immediately cast an apparition spell that can be cast using that slot. The number of actions required for Echo of Spirits is equal to the action cost of the spell cast. Maintaining control after such a surge is difficult, however; after casting the spell, you're [[Conditions/Confused|Confused]] until the end of your next turn.
