# Eternal Legend Dedication
## Feat 12
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[destiny]][[mythic]]

**Category** class; 




As your renown as a fighter grows, your Calling comes to fruition. Almost nothing can keep you down. During your daily preparations, choose clumsy, drained, or enfeebled. For the remainder of the day, when you roll a success against an effect that would impose that condition on you, you get a critical success instead. In addition, anytime you gain the chosen condition, reduce its value by 1. You can change the chosen condition with a single action that has the concentrate trait.
