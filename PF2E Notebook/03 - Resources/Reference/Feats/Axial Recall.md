# Axial Recall
## Feat 17
### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")[[automaton]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You have reconfigured the magical resonance of your core to attune to the planar energies of Axis. You can cast [[Spells/Interplanar Teleport|Interplanar Teleport]] twice per week as an arcane innate spell that can only target yourself; you can travel only to Axis or the Material Plane, and your body serves as the focus component.
