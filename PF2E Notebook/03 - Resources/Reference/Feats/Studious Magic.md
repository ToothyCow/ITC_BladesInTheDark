# Studious Magic
## Feat 1
### [[anadi]]

**Category** ancestry; 




You've taken an interest in anadi arcane traditions. Choose one cantrip from the arcane spell list. You can cast this spell as an arcane innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
