# Pristine Weapon
## Feat 10
### [[druid]]

**Category** class; 



**Prerequisites** Verdant Weapon
* * *
Your verdant weapon can cut through the resistances of magical creatures. The weapon is treated as cold iron and silver. If you critically hit a creature that has a weakness to cold iron or silver, the target takes 1d6 bleed damage as the primal energies within your weapon slow its natural healing.
