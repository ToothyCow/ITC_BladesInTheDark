# Extract Element
## Feat 3
### [[kineticist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Creatures with a strong tie to your element might be troublesome for you to deal with, at least until you've learned to turn their elemental nature to your advantage. You gain the [[Actions/Extract Element|Extract Element]] action.
