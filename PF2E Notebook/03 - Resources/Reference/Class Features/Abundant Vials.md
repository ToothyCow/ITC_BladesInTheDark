## Feat 17
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You're permanently [[Conditions/Quickened|Quickened]], and can use the extra action only to use [[Actions/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]] to create a quick vial. You can create only one vial with this action, even if you have double brew or a similar ability.
