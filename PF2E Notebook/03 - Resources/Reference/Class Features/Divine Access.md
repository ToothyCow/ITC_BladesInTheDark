# Divine Access
## Feat 11
### [[oracle]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your mystery offers you strange access to spells typically reserved for more conventional worshippers. Choose one deity who grants one of your mystery's granted domains. Add up to three cleric spells of your choice granted by that deity to your spell list, and to your spell repertoire as soon as you can cast spells of the appropriate rank.
