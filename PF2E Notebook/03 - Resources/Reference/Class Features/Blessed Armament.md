# Blessed Armament

### [[champion]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Select one weapon or handwraps of mighty blows. You gain that armament's critical specialization effect, and you grant the armament a property rune of your choice from the following list: [[Equipment/Fearsome|Fearsome]], [[Equipment/Ghost Touch|Ghost Touch]], [[Equipment/Returning|Returning]], [[Equipment/Shifting|Shifting]], or [[Equipment/Vitalizing|Vitalizing]]. During your daily preparations, you can change the spirit to inhabit a different armament, grant a different rune, or both.
