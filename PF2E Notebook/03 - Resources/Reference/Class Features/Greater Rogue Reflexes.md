# Greater Rogue Reflexes
## Feat 13
### [[rogue]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You elude danger to a degree that few can match. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.
