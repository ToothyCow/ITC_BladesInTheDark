# Dominion Epithet
## Feat 7
### [[exemplar]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your divinity has grown in power along with your deeds, allowing you to begin claiming dominion over aspects of creation. Choose one of the following epithets. Each one grants a critical specialization ability you can use instead of any others you might have access to, and an ability you can use when you Spark Transcendence. You can benefit from no more than one epithet ability each time you Spark Transcendence. Some epithets grant additional benefits, such as feats.
