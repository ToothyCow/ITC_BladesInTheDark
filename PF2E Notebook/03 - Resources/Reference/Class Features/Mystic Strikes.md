# Mystic Strikes
## Feat 3
### [[monk]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Focusing your will into your physical attacks imbues them with mystical energy. Your unarmed attacks become magical, allowing them to get past resistances to non-magical attacks. However, you still need an item such as [[Equipment/Handwraps of Mighty Blows|Handwraps of Mighty Blows (+1)]] to gain an item bonus to attack rolls or increase your attacks' weapon damage dice.
