# Field Discovery (Mutagenist)
## Feat 5
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




The mutagens flowing through your blood have altered your body chemistry. When you roll a Fortitude save while affected by a mutagen and dislike the result, you can end the effect of the mutagen to reroll the save. This is a fortune effect.
