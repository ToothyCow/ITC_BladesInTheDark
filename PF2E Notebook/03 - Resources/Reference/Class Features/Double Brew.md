# Double Brew
## Feat 9
### [[alchemist]]

**Category** classfeature; 




You know your formulas so well that you can concoct two items at once.

When using the [[Actions/Quick Alchemy|Quick Alchemy]] action, you can create two items. These items don't have to be the same. If you create two consumables, you have to expend a versatile vial for each one.
