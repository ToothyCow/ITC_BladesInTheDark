# Revitalizing Rage
## Feat 17
### [[barbarian]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your rage sustains you more frequently, leaving you ready to jump into battle anew. Instead of needing to wait 1 minute before you can gain temporary Hit Points from Rage again, you need only to spend at least one full turn not in a Rage.
