# Mysterious Resolve
## Feat 7
### [[oracle]]

**Category** classfeature; 




The power of your mystery blazing in your soul makes it harder for other powers to grip your mind. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.
