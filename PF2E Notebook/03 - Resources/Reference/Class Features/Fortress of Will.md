# Fortress of Will
## Feat 17
### [[psychic]]

**Category** classfeature; 




Your trained mind is as a fortress that none can breach. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you critically fail a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.
