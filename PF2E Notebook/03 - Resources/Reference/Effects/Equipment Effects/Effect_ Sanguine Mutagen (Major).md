## Level 17
### 






Granted by [[Equipment/Sanguine Mutagen (Major)|Sanguine Mutagen (Major)]]

**Benefit** You gain a +4 item bonus to Fortitude and Reflex saves. When you roll a success on a save against a disease, poison, or effect that would give you the Fatigued condition, you get a critical success instead and your critical failures on such saves become failures instead.

**Drawback** Whenever you take piercing or slashing damage, you take 1d6 bleed.
