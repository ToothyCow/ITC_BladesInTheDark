# Effect: Dragon Throat Scale
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Equipment/Dragon Throat Scale|Dragon Throat Scale]]

Your _force barrage_ loses the force trait and damage type, and instead it has the damage type of the breath weapon belonging to the dragon the scale came from, along with that trait.
