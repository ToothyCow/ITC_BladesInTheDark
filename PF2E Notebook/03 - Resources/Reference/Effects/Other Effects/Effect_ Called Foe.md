# Effect: Called Foe
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[PF2e Journals/Hero Point Deck/Called Foe|Called Foe]]

Designate a foe that you can see. You gain a +2 status bonus to attack rolls made against that foe, but you take a -4 status penalty to attack rolls made against any other creature. This lasts until the end of your next turn or until you critically hit the designated foe, whichever comes first.
