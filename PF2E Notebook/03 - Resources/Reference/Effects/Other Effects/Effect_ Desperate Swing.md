# Effect: Desperate Swing
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[PF2e Journals/Hero Point Deck/Desperate Swing|Desperate Swing]]

Make a Strike, ignoring the multiple attack penalty. If you roll a critical success, you get a normal success instead. If the attack fails, you release your weapon, or drop Prone if you were using an unarmed attack or otherwise can't release your weapon.
