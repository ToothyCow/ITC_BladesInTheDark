# Stance: Drifting Pollen
## Level 1
### 






Granted by [[Feats/Drifting Pollen|Drifting Pollen]]

A creature in your kinetic aura when you enter the stance, or who later enters the aura or ends its turn in the aura, attempts at a Fortitude save against your class DC. On a failure, it's sickened 1 (sickened 2 on a critical failure) and dazzled until it's no longer sickened. A creature attempts this save no more than once per round and doesn't attempt a new save if already affected.
