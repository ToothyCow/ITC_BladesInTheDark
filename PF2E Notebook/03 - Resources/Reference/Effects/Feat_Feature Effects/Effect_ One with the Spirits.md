### 






Granted by [[Feats/One with the Spirits|One with the Spirits]]

You gain fast healing 5 and you become concealed. Your Strikes gain the benefits of a _ghost touch_ property rune. Whenever you deal damage with a Strike, you can choose to have that Strike deal spirit damage, rather than its usual damage type.
