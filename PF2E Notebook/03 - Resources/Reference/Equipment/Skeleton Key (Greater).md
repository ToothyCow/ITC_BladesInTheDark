# Skeleton Key (Greater)
## Item 11
### [[magical]]


**Price** 1250 gp; 
**Bulk** 0; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

A grinning skull tops the bow of this macabre key. This key can be used in place of thieves' toolkit when attempting to Pick a Lock, and it grants a +2 item bonus to the Thievery check.

If the _skeleton key_ becomes broken due to a critical failure on the check, it works as normal thieves' toolkit and loses its benefits until repaired.

**Activate—Loosen Lock** `pf2:0` (manipulate)

**Frequency** once per hour

**Trigger** You attempt to Pick a Lock but haven't rolled yet

* * *

**Effect** The key casts [[Spells/Knock|Knock]] on the lock you're trying to pick.
