# Depth Gauge

### [uncommon](uncommon "Uncommon Rarity Trait")


**Price** 1 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-two-hands

This simple tool consists of a small iron weight attached to a thin rope that is marked at regular intervals (typically every foot). It can be used to measure the depth of a hole or body of water by dropping the weight down into unknown depths and counting the markings on the rope. It can also be used as a plumb bob.
