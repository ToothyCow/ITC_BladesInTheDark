This miniature club is typically affixed to a weapon by an iron chain. When you activate the cudgel, you use [[Feats/Brutal Finish|Brutal Finish]], as the fighter feat. You must meet the normal requirements, including those of the press trait.

If you have the Brutal Finish feat, add an additional weapon damage die on a success or a failure to the normal results.
