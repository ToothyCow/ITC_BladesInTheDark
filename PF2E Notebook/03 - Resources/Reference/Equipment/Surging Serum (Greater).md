Involuntary jolts and surges of energy move through the drinker's body as it restores normal muscle control. When you drink this elixir, it counteracts at 6th-rank and has a +19 Counteract Modifier to remove the [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy]] or [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled]] condition from a single source, using the source of that condition to determine the counteract rank and DC.
