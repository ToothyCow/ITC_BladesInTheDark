# Wand of Crushing Leaps
## Item 4
### [[magical]][[wand]]


**Price** 80 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** held-in-one-hand

This supple, light wooden wand drifts to the ground like a feather or leaf when dropped, landing unharmed. A thin coil of metal wraps around the wand's handle.

**Activate** Cast a Spell

**Frequency** once per day, plus overcharge

* * *

**Effect** You cast [[Spells/Jump|Jump]], but can jump up to 60 feet. When you land you shatter the ground, making each creature in a 5-foot emanation [[Conditions/Off-Guard|Off-Guard]] until the start of its next turn. In addition, the space you land in and all squares in the emanation become difficult terrain for 1 minute.

* * *

**Craft Requirements** Supply a casting of 1st-rank [[Spells/Jump|Jump]].
