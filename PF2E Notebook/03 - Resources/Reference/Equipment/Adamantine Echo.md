# Adamantine Echo
## Item 5
### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[earth]][[invested]][[magical]][[relic]]


**Price** 0 gp; 
**Bulk** L; **Size** med
**Usage** etched-onto-armor

Made from glossy, nearly black adamantine, this large fragment of a plate armor vambrace provides little protection on its own. However, when incorporated into an intact suit of armor, it functions as a +1 armor potency rune.
