A popular choice for investigators studying alchemy, insight coffee is infused with alchemical flavoring during percolation. For 1 hour after you drink an insight coffee, you use d8s instead of d6s for your extra damage from the strategic strike class feature, if you have it. You also gain a +4 item bonus to checks to Recall Knowledge with a skill determined by the blend chosen when the item is crafted.
