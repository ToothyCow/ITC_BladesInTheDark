# Casandalee - Major Boon

### 






Casandalee backs up your memory and soul within her divine data flow.

After you die, she casts your consciousness into a new artificial body. While Casandalee constructed your new body artificially, it is otherwise similar to the old, with the same effects as a critical success on a [[Spells/Resurrect|Resurrect]] ritual. Casandalee is instead willing to provide different bodies to those who request them.
