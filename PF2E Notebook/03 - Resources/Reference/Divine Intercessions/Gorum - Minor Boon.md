# Gorum - Minor Boon

### 

**Category** deityboon; 




Gorum grants you a weapon whenever you need one.

You can use an Interact action to draw a 0-level non-magical iron weapon, even if you have no weapons on your person. Such a weapon lasts only as long as you continue using it to attack, and it can't be sold, given away, melted for scrap iron, or the like.
