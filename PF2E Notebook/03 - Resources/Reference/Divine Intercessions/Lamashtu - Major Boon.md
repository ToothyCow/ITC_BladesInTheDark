# Lamashtu - Major Boon

### 

**Category** deityboon; 




Lamashtu uses your body to birth a new monster, regardless of your gender.

Once per day, you can spend 1 minute to birth a monster determined by the GM, which rips its way from your belly. The monster's level is up to your level and it does as it pleases, following Lamashtu's will, though it doesn't attack you unless you have lost her favor. You are [[Conditions/Drained|Drained 3]] from the ordeal.
