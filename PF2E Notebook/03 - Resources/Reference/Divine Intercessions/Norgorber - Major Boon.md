# Norgorber - Major Boon

### 

**Category** deityboon; 




You become a living secret.

You are immune to divination effects and attempts to magically alter your memory, unless you choose to be affected or those effects come from a deity, artifact, or similarly powerful source. You also can never be tricked or forced by mundane means into uttering a secret you wish to keep.
