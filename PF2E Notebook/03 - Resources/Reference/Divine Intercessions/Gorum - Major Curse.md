# Gorum - Major Curse

### 

**Category** curse; 




You are unable to keep up with the rigors of combat. The moment a combat breaks out, you become [[Conditions/Fatigued|Fatigued]] and [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed 1]]. At the end of each of your turns, your [[Conditions/Slowed|Slowed]] condition increases by 1. These conditions end only when you are no longer in combat.
