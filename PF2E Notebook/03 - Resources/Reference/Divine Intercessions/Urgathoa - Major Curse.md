# Urgathoa - Major Curse

### 

**Category** curse; 




Urgathoa teaches you that pointless lives in slavery to death and morality are bound to end in tragedy.

You develop an incurable wasting disease that leaves you [[Conditions/Clumsy|Clumsy 2]], [[Conditions/Enfeebled|Enfeebled 2]], and unable to move except by [[Actions/Crawl|Crawling]]. This disease never progresses further to kill you, but it passes to your friends and loved ones merely by sight, wasting them away unto death before your eyes and causing them to rise as undead to haunt you.
