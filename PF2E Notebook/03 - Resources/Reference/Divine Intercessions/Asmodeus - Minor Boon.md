# Asmodeus - Minor Boon

### 

**Category** deityboon; 




Pleased by your talent for manipulation, Asmodeus amplifies your skills.

Once, when you fail at the Diplomacy check to make a significant or consequential [[Actions/Request|Request]], you can cast [[Spells/Suggestion|Suggestion]] on the target of your Request, suggesting the same course of action. This is a divine innate spell.
