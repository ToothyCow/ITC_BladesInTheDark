# Rovagug - Minor Boon

### 

**Category** deityboon; 




Your attack becomes more destructive.

Once, one of your failed or successful attacks becomes a critical hit, and your weapon or unarmed attack gains the deadly d12 trait for this attack, replacing any deadly trait it already had.

[[Divine Intercessions/Effect_ Rovagug's Destruction|Effect: Rovagug's Destruction]]

Rovagug typically grants this boon when the critical hit could destroy something precious or significant.
