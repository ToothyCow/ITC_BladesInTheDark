# Besmara - Moderate Boon

### 






You are at home on the seas and always ready to plunder an enemy vessel or defend your own. When aboard a boat, you gain a +2 status bonus to all initiative rolls, Acrobatics checks to [[Actions/Balance|Balance]], and Athletics checks to [[Actions/Climb|Climb]]. In addition, you never get seasick.
