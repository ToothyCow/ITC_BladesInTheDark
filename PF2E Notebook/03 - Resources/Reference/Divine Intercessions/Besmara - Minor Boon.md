# Besmara - Minor Boon

### 






Besmara wants you to amuse her, placing both plunder and peril in your path.

This intercession often takes the form of an unexpected treasure map, a message in a bottle, or some other sign leading you to a great reward, assuming you can handle the challenges along the way.
