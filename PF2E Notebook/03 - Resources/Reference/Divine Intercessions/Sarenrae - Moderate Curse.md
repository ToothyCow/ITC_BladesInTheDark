# Sarenrae - Moderate Curse

### 

**Category** curse; 




The sun shines its light on everything you say.

You become unable to tell [[Actions/Lie|Lies]], and if you attempt to do so, you instead compulsively blurt out the truth on the matter in question. You are still able to withhold information or lie by omission.
