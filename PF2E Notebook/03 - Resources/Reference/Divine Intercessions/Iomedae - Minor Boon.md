# Iomedae - Minor Boon

### 

**Category** deityboon; 




You always present yourself at your best. Your clothing and person are always clean and unrumpled, the metal of your blade and armor shining and unblemished.

This doesn't prevent you from being exposed to diseases and other afflictions via filth, but it protects you as well as if you had washed thoroughly right away.
