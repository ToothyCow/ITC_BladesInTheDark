# Alseta - Major Boon

### 






You transition unimpeded through the world.

You can open any door or portal simply by placing your palm upon it with a single Interact action, even if it's locked or magically sealed, and you can enter any open door or threshold, even if it's magically warded to prevent entry. This doesn't overcome the locks and magic of artifacts, deities, and similarly powerful effects.
