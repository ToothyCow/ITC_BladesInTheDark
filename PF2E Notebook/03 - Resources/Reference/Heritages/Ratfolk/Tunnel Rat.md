# Tunnel Rat

### 






You can easily compress your body and squeeze through gaps. You gain the [[Feats/Quick Squeeze|Quick Squeeze]] feat as a bonus feat, even if you aren't trained in Acrobatics. Tight spaces not tight enough to require the [[Actions/Squeeze|Squeeze]] action aren't difficult terrain for you.
