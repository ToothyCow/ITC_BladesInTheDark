# Frightful Goloma

### 






Your face has a particularly off-putting appearance. You are trained in Intimidation (or another skill of your choice if you were already trained in Intimidation) and gain the [[Feats/Intimidating Glare|Intimidating Glare]] skill feat as a bonus feat.

_Note: If you are already trained in the skill provided by this feat, you need to manually select an alternative skill._
