# Shadow of the Hermit

### [[wayang]]






Your shadow seems somehow full of secrets and mysteries—secrets that it shares with you. Choose one cantrip from the occult spell list. You can cast this spell as an occult innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
