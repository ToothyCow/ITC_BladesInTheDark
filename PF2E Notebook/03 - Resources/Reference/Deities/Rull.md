# Rull

### 

**Category** deity; 




Rull was supposedly the first orc to become a god when his people breached the surface, challenging lightning itself in order to take his place as a deity. He has little interest in the details of life, seeking to spread disorder wherever he goes.

**Edicts** create chaos at every opportunity, be loud wherever you go, spread fear and terror in Rull's name

**Anathema** enforce law and order, show mercy, allow morals to impede the sowing of chaos
