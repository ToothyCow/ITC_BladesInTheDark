# Grask Uldeth

### 

**Category** deity; 




Though Grask espoused the values of partnership and trade in life, he is a strict adherent of idea that might is right and that one should use their strength to improve life for everyone. Grask expects his followers to follow a strict hierarchy and stay in line.

**Edicts** improve orcs' lot in life, obey the orcs above your station, rule the orcs below you with a strong hand

**Anathema** allow orc-kind to become weak, intentionally make orcs look bad, disrupt your hierarchy without just cause
