# Uirch

### 

**Category** deity; 




Uirch promotes using one's strength to defend the weak and employing systems to benefit the people. His teachings are antithetical to many traditional orc beliefs, making his edicts a challenge to accept.

**Edicts** protect the weak and innocent, keep your word, do not throw your life away needlessly

**Anathema** allow tyranny to stand uncontested, put your own safety before those in need of defending, make a promise with the intent to break it
