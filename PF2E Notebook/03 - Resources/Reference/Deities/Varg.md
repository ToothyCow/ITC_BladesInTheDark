# Varg

### 

**Category** deity; 




Varg loves innovation and technology, but only for the purposes of combat. His followers are encouraged to use tactics and clever tinkering to get around their problems, but technology is reserved for warfare.

**Edicts** use tactics rather than relying solely on brute force or overwhelming numbers, use siege engines for combat whenever possible, seek out new technology

**Anathema** pursue technology for non-combat purposes, use machinery and other advanced technology outside of combat, keep advanced weaponry or battle tactics a secret from orcs
