# Mahja Firehair

### 

**Category** deity; 




Mahja takes inspiration from Sarenrae, having worshipped her in life, but she believes that redemption must be actively earned rather than freely given. She scorns those who offer empty promises and rewards those who choose to prove their worth through their actions.

**Edicts** bring honor and glory to orcs, build up your community, seek personal perfection

**Anathema** undermine your community, seek personal glory, grant redemption to the unworthy
