# Jukha

### 

**Category** deity; 




As a mortal, Jukha was a charismatic young dromaar with great ambitions of uniting her people to defeat Tar-Baphon. Ultimately failing to keep her followers together, the ambitious youth perished alone but managed to ascend, transforming into a goddess of big game hunting. Having learned from her mistakes, Jukha emphasizes the need to band together to accomplish one's goals.

**Edicts** work together, push each other to greater heights, respect the animals you hunt

**Anathema** abandon or betray your people, refuse to learn from your mistakes, isolate yourself
