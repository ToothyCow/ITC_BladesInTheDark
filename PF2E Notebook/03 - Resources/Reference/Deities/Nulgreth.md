# Nulgreth

### 

**Category** deity; 




One of the most ancient of the orc gods, Nulgreth demands bloodshed wherever his followers go. In a way, Nulgreth is an embodiment of other nations' beliefs about orc culture.

**Edicts** bathe in the blood of your fallen enemies, face your enemies head-on, never turn down a fight you can win

**Anathema** grant or accept mercy, take prisoners, perform underhanded tricks
