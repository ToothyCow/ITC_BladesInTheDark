# Build Library

### [[downtime]][[manipulate]]

**Category** interaction; 




**Requirements** Crafting (master), any Lore (master), or hired bookmaker; organized specialists

* * *

Pick a single room in Citadel Altaerein to serve as a library. Once complete, the library grants a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks made to Borrow an Arcane Spell, Create Forgery, Decipher Writing, Identify Alchemy, Identify Magic, Learn a Spell, or Recall Knowledge as long as the PC performing the action is on site. This upgrade takes 20 days of work and a DC 25 Crafting check or Lore check.
