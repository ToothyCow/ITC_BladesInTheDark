# Goloma

### [rare](rare "Rare Rarity Trait")[[goloma]][[humanoid]]



**Size** med


_Golomas fear most other people and deliberately use their unusual biology to frighten off those they consider to be dangerous predators. Rarely seen and poorly understood, golomas' many-eyed and wooden faced visages instill terror in most they meet._
