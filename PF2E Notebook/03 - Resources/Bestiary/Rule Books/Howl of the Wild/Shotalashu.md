    desc: "  While a shotalashu can't speak, even telepathically, it understands simple commands in the languages it knows. It returns telepathic sensations of emotion to creatures touching it or the partner of its telepathic link at any distance."

  - name: "Telepathic Link"
    desc: " (mental,occult) A rider who would tame a shotalashu for a mount must first form a telepathic link with it. Establishing this link require spending a week with the desired mount and succeeding at a DC 21 Occultism check check. Any creature with telepathic capabilities, such as telepathy, touch telepathy, empathic sense, or the ability to cast spells such as [[Spells/Telepathy|Telepathy]], gains a +4 circumstance bonus to this check. This link remains and neither can form a new link until one member dies. The shock of a partner dying leaves the survivor [[Conditions/Stupefied|Stupefied 2]] for 24 hours and prevents forming a new link for at least a month."
