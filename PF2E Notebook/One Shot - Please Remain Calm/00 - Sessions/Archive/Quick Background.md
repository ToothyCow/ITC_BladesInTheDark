[Music goes here]()

- The past has ceased to exist
- 300 years ago, all societies came to their senses, realizing the last 3000 years of history had been swallowed up in "The Gap"
- Books erased, files corrupted, gods silent
- Vesk and Azlanti formed their empires, the Pact Worlds built their alliance, and the Swarm threatened to devour all
- Most people are like you, though. You just want to survive another day.
