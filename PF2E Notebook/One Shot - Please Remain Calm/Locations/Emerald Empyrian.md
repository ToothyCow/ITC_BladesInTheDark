A pleasure barge owned by a Vercite company called Trendsetter Excursions.

**Computers Check:**
- 10+: The only ways to enter the ship are through two airlock doors, one on the port side near the aft and one on the starboard side near the fore. The forward airlock is completely sealed shut, but the aft airlock could be forced open. 
- 15+: The Emerald Empyrean is a modified heavy freighter with a forward-facing heavy weapon and a small turret weapon, but plenty of room for passengers and recreational activities. Though its thrusters are active, they are currently idle, and the ship has enough power to provide artificial gravity, interior lighting, and life support.
- 20+: Further scans reveal over a dozen life signs aboard the ship, which [[Quonx]] missed on his initial scans. Most of these life signs are concentrated in an area in the ship’s aft, on the starboard side. [[Quonx]]'s life signs are visible, but he is currently in a semi-conscious state and his location cannot be pinpointed. An additional anomalous energy signature is detected in the ship’s center.
- 25+: It appears that most of the Emerald Empyrean’s functions are controlled by a single onboard artificial intelligence core, which is very unusual for a ship this size. However, the AI doesn’t respond to any attempts to communicate with it.

## Bio
The Emerald Empyrean is a converted heavy freighter, with luxurious accommodations for a dozen passengers. It’s designed to resemble the Vercite aetherships of old, with plush carpeting, brass fixtures, and a bright color palette. Every aspect of the vessel has been designed with comfort in mind.


## Background
An AI called [[M2]] was granted control over every aspect of the trip (including all of the vessel’s onboard computers and robots), allowing for only a skeleton crew to keep things running smoothly. Unfortunately, due to an unprecedented math error in its programming, M2 decided that the ship’s intended destination would not be relaxing enough for its passengers and rerouted the Emerald Empyrean to a section of empty space outside of the Pact Worlds system. When the crew realized something was wrong, it was already too late. M2 had maneuvered the Emerald Empyrean out of the Pact Worlds and into Near Space, where it would take days for help to arrive.

In the meantime, the AI grew increasingly erratic, shutting down portions of the ship and slipping sedatives into the food to keep the passengers “relaxed.” The AI even directly attacked those crew members who attempted to repair her computer core. The Emerald Empyrean’s dozen guests grew desperate as they were unable to trust the very mechanisms that were designed to keep them comfortable. The passengers eventually barricaded themselves in the ship’s bar and restaurant and have survived on alcohol and self-preparing meals for over a week.
