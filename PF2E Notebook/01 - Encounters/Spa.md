# Story
When the PCs approach the door to this chamber, they can hear an angry bellowing from within. A skittermander who succeeds at a DC 12 Perception check recognizes Nakonechkin’s shouting.
> The tiled walls of this room are colored a soothing sea-foam green. Three cushioned tables occupy the center of the room,each with a plethora of mechanical arms ending in various nozzles, manipulator digits, and other implements. A series of chairs runs along the starboard side of the room, with apertures in the wall behind them. The air is humid and smells of sandalwood.
This area is an automated spa for the Emerald Empyrean’s passengers. A trio of massage tables could relax three guests, while gentle music and a moisturizing steam were pumped in through vents near the ceiling. Guests seeking exfoliating scrubs or hydrating seaweed masks could sit in one of the chairs, and robotic arms would provide the service they requested. Unfortunately, M2’s ideas of relaxation have made this area unsafe.
Nakonechkin, the skittermanders’ boss, is currently trapped on the central massage table, being kneaded and pummeled to a ridiculous degree. He stumbled into this room after bolting through the observation deck and was immediately grabbed by the table because M2 deemed him too tense. Nakonechkin’s constant struggling hasn’t lessened the AI’s opinions of the vesk’s state of mind. The PCs can release Nakonechkin by spending a full action and succeeding at a DC 16 Engineering check while adjacent to the table. Traps: Since the skittermanders boarded the ship, M2
has overpowered the massage tables, and any unoccupied tables now actively reach out to grab and pummel nearby creatures into relaxation. The massage tables can be disabled as described below, but if the PCs decide to attack them, each table’s grabbing arms have an EAC of 10 and a KAC of 14, a hardness of 5, and 15 Hit Points.

Development: Once Nakonechkin is freed, he thanks the PCs in his typically gruff manner. “Quasar’s light, that machine nearly massaged me to death!
Thanks fuzzballs, you saved my tail.” Nakonechkin snorts. “We aren’t done here, though! If you’re up to it, you should head to the bridge and see if we still can’t bring this hunk of junk home. Trendsetter will probably fork over a sizeable chunk of credits to keep this quiet.”
