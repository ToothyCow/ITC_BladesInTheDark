# Story
A cloying magical darkness cloaks this area and dampens all nonmagical light sources, allowing them to provide no brighter than dim light. This darkness makes it difficult to see even with exceptional vision or magical light. A source of nonmagical light has its area of effect reduced to a radius of 10 feet (if its radius is normally less than 10 feet, the radius is unchanged). A source of magical light has its area of effect reduced to a radius of 15 feet (though it retains its normal intensity.) A creature with darkvision has its vision reduced to 20 feet.
The circular chamber contains two rows of reclining seats curving around a central space. The ceiling appears to be made from a dome of transparent aluminum, but panels covering the outside of the dome block the view. Four pedestals, each topped with a large chunk of onyx, are evenly spaced
around the outside of the room. Doors lead forward and aft.
When the Emerald Empyrean passed near interesting cosmic phenomena, passengers came to this room to witness the scenery through the domed ceiling and relax in the recliners. The observation deck was also open around the clock for those who just wanted to stargaze. The pieces of onyx are slightly enchanted to absorb nearby light sources, so as not to ruin anyone’s view of the cosmos outside. A set of shutters on the outside of the vessel close over the window when necessary. As M2’s programming became more corrupt, she came to believe that her passengers required a room of soothing darkness in which to relax. She closed the room’s shutters and fed power into the light-absorbing gemstones, creating the supernatural darkness that now engulfs the room.

This also thinned the boundary between the Material Plane and the Shadow Plane, attracting a group of shadow creepers, insectoid vermin native to that plane (see Creatures on page 7). A PC who enters the room and succeeds at a DC 13 Mysticism or Physical Science check recognizes that the darkness isn’t natural and can be sustained only by a nearby source of magic; the same check allows the PC to notice a planar eddy of swirling shadow in the center of the room. The eddy has no effect on the PCs, other than affecting the light in the area. A PC adjacent to one of the onyx-adorned pedestals (located at the northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest edges of the circular chamber) can attempt a DC 18 Mysticism check to power down the onyx atop it; if at least three of the onyxes are powered down, the supernatural darkness dissipates and the eddy collapses. Creatures: Six shadow creepers crawl around the center
of the room, ready to attack any other creatures that enter. Shadow creepers look like centipedes the size of a house cat made from smoky darkness. One round after a shadow creeper is destroyed, another comes through the thin spot between the planes in the center of the room. When the supernatural darkness dissipates, any remaining shadow creepers are instantly destroyed.
