#### Monster Info:
[[00 - Encounter Building Tables]]
Encounter: Medium Threat, XP: 120
- [[Observer-class Security Robot]] x4 - (level 1 x3, 120XP)


#### Intro
- Tether to your ship, spacewalk across
- [[Emerald Empyrian]] floats before you, majestic, powerful, and lifeless
- You enter through the airlock, and find yourself in a square chamber with little in the way of furnishings. The walls and ceiling are a clean white, while the floor is a silvery metal. Four cages are stacked in the two forward corners of the room. A heavy door leads into the airlock to the port, while a flickering holographic sign reading “Welcome Guests” floats over the door to the starboard.
- Three observer-class security robots float about here, buzzing and humming to themselves. When you step in from the airlock, these robots quickly scan you. One speaks up:
	- deep, vaguely soothing voice. 
	- If Skittermanders:
	> 	“We're terribly sorry. Pets must be placed in approved carriers before boarding the Emerald Empyrean. Initiating containment protocols. Please remain calm.”
	- Else:
	> 	"Welcome aboard, valued guests. We look forward to your company on this delightful, relaxing journey. Please enjoy these pills to begin the path towards tranquility."
	- When the PCs refuse:
	> 	"Error - Guests resisting sedatives. Initiate relaxation protocols. Please remain calm."
