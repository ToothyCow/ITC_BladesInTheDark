# Story
Once the skittermanders reach the engineering deck, the only thing left to do to save the ship is to shut down M2’s computer nodes. However, the AI is fully aware of their presence and does everything in her power to save herself. Her voice pipes in over the ship’s intercom system, her once calm tone now betraying a hint of madness.
> “Attention passengers. My sensors indicate that the ship is infested with small, furry menaces. But do not be alarmed, your crew has it under control. In just a few minutes, we will be venting the interior of the ship out into space to deal with the problem. You may experience a slight loss in cabin pressure, followed by the thrilling sensation of zero gravity and unparalleled views of the surrounding star field. That is all.”


Despite the threat of imminent depressurization hanging over them, the PCs should have ample time to crawl into the vessel’s ductwork, find M2’s computer nodes, and deactivate them. However, no map of this part of the ship is stored in its database, as servicing of the ducts usually occurs while the Emerald Empyrean is in spacedock. There is no set timer for depressurization, but you should encourage the PCs not to dally too long after the AI threatens to vent the Emerald Empyrean’s atmosphere. 

Bridge (CR 3) The door to the bridge is locked (hardness 20, HP 60, break DC 28). A PC who succeeds at a DC 22 Engineering check can override the electronic locking mechanism. When the door is unlocked, it automatically hisses open. Consoles and monitors line the walls and the ceiling of this small bridge. Viewscreens show various angles of space just outside the exterior of the ship, and displays note the ship’s oxygen levels, internal temperatures, power output, hull strength, and the status of other systems. When M2 began overseeing the operation of the Emerald Empyrean, the ship’s bridge was refurbished accordingly, and it is now far more austere than that of a normal starship. The displays and viewscreens allowed crew members to check on the ship’s status or override the AI if necessary. M2 has locked out all of the consoles here, which a PC can recognize with a successful DC 12 Computers or Engineering check. A PC who succeeds at this check by 5 or more also knows that control can be reestablished by rebooting the computer core, which is most likely located on the engineering deck. Creature: Kenjaro Chidi, the crew member with the most engineering experience, came to the bridge to assess the problem when the first signs of M2’s glitches appeared. M2 believed Kenjaro to be overexcited when he began trying to shut down her control over the ship and delivered what she thought was a mild electric shock to snap him out of that state. Unfortunately, the electricity caused a feedback loop in Kenjaro’s numerous cybernetics and killed him. A few hours later, he rose again as a cybernetic zombie. M2 has since locked the door to prevent Kenjaro from roaming the ship and harming the passengers. When the PCs enter, the zombie ferociously attacks.

Navigating the Ducts: The ducts are just tall enough for a
Small creature—like a skittermander—to move through while half-crouching. To find a computer node, a PC must succeed at a DC 14 Intelligence check to navigate the twisting passages. Each failed check grants a cumulative +1 circumstance bonus to that skittermander’s next Intelligence check; rolling a natural 1 removes this bonus for that skittermander, who gets turned around. Finding a computer node also resets this bonus. M2 Nodes: To deactivate a computer node, a PC must succeed
at a DC 18 Computers check or DC 23 Engineering check as a full action. There are a total of five nodes, and the PCs must deactivate three of them to remove M2’s influence over the ship. However, after the PCs attempt to deactivate the first node, the AI begins to take drastic measures. She floods a 10-foot area near the next computer node with medium radiation (Core Rulebook 404) when a creature approaches it (remember that each PC’s armor provides a +4 bonus against this effect). M2 can release this radiation only once. After the PCs deactivate the second node, M2 discharges a gout of electricity at the creature that approaches the next computer node; the target takes 6d6 electricity damage (Reflex DC 14 half). She can do this only once. A PC who is adjacent to a computer node or on the engineering deck can attempt a DC 15 Computers check to realize that M2 has set up countermeasures near her computer nodes. A PC who succeeds at this check also notes that the AI likely can’t tell the skittermanders apart while they are in the ducts; to deal with each trap, one skittermander can set off the trap by simply approaching the computer node it guards, leaving his comrades free to perform the necessary deactivation skill checks. When the PCs deactivate the third node, M2’s voice comes
over the intercom system once more with a final message, her voice slowing with each word.
