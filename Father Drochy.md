Minister of Cultivation, high-elf druid sage, noble merchant, relic of a bygone era
Sagging, tired posture. Old, weary voice. Real downer of a person - jumps to worst case scenarios whenever possible.

The only remaining member of [[The Five Sages]] on the ruling council. All others have been supplanted by commoners or usurpers. Desperately trying to fight for the Ariosa he knew, but it may be far too late to reclaim it.

Opportunities:
- Hates the Ravens Guild and other upstart "technology" (Bah). Suspects their ambitions and their ruthlessness, but has no proof
- Traditionalist - wants to return to how things used to be
- Disagrees with [[Dominus Caius]]'s methods and trajectory, but fears he lacks support to truly fight back

Pitfalls:
- Hates greed and corruption
- Hates newfangled technology
- Resistant to change
