### Actions

**Multiattack.** The Queen of Night and Magic makes three Rapier or Star Strike attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of *Spellcasting* or *Unravel*.

**Rapier.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) cold damage.

**Star Strike.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 17 (2d8 + 8) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage.

**Unravel.** The Queen of Night and Magic ends one magical effect she can see within 60 feet of her. To do so, she must succeed on a Charisma check against a DC of 10 + the spell's level or the magical effect's DC, whichever is higher.

**Shadow Rift (Recharge 5–6).** The Queen of Night and Magic creates a shadowy rift at a point she can see within 120 feet.  
Each creature within 20 feet must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 36 (8d8) cold damage and 36 (8d8) necrotic damage and is restrained by icy shadows for 1 minute. On a success, it takes half damage and isn’t restrained. A restrained creature can repeat the save at the end of its turns to end the effect.

**Spellcasting.** The Queen of Night and Magic casts one of the following spells, using Charisma (spell save DC 23):

- **At will:** *command, dancing lights, darkness, mage hand, suggestion*  
- **3/day each:** *confusion, fear, greater invisibility, mirror image*  
- **1/day each:** *dominate monster, plane shift, power word stun*

### Bonus Actions

**Hidden Step.** The Queen magically teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space she can see and takes the Hide action.

---

### Reactions

**Sudden Fraying.** When targeted by a spell or included in a spell's area that does not have an instantaneous duration, the Queen can use *Unravel* as a reaction. She doesn’t need to see the entire spell but must see at least some part of an affected area or object.

### Legendary Actions

The Queen of Night and Magic can take 3 legendary actions, using the options below. Only one option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature’s turn. She regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.

- **Move.** Moves up to her walking speed or half her flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Uses *Spellcasting*.
- **Swirling Stars (Costs 2 Actions).** Stars on her gown pulse. Each creature within 15 feet must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.
