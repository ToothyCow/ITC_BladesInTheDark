- **Senses:** darkvision 60 ft.
- **Perception:** 10
- **Stealth:** 8
- **Languages:** understands the languages it knew in life but can’t speak

### Special Abilities

- **Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 HP, it must make a CON save with a DC equal to 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 HP instead.
- **Undead Nature.** The zombie doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Undead Resilience.** The zombie is immune to poison damage, to exhaustion, and to the poisoned condition.

### Actions

- **Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 12) if it is a Medium or smaller creature, and the zombie doesn’t already have a creature grappled.

### Bonus Actions

- **Rotten Hold.** The zombie gnaws idly on the creature grappled by it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 CON save or take 2 (1d4) poison damage. A Humanoid slain by this bonus action rises 24 hours later as a zombie, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed.
