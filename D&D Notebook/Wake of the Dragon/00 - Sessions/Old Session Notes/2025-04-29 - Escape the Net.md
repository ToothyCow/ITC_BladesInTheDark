OVERALL

- It is a time of changes - political, technological, magical
- Nearly 100 years ago, the Burning Hordes attacked the free peoples of [[Wake of the Dragon/Locations/Ariosa]], razing the country with dragonfire
- In desperation, the general deposed the monarchy, imposed martial law, and unified the land for war
- All seemed lost until magical research yielded powerful weaponry capable of rending dragon hide and decimating battlefields
- After nearly a century of conflict, the Burning Hordes have been defeated, and nearly all dragons killed
- Guardians, once the sole keepers of magic, are wrestling with the new Wizardry and Artificer guilds
- The Tyrannus has maintained leadership of Ariosa, but the people grow restless under this wartime dictator
- In the shadows, rumors of dragon cults and horrific creatures swirl and grow
- Change is coming

  

LAST TIME:

- Caught Hag impersonating [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Marris Velka]] and sneaking into [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]]‘s house
- Fought, but hag released two ogres and turned invisible. Ogres killed, but hag escaped
- [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]] thanks party for coming to his aid
    - Concerned about what the hag was trying to do
- [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Thrum Boska]] accused of dragon worship
    - Evidence:
        - letters to and from known dragon cult members hidden within belongings, hastily edited to appear to implicate [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]]
        - confessions from captured cult members
        - Warlock’s Dragon Totem - +1, maximize 3 dmg dice
    - Result: [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Carwin Steeljaw - Guardian Knight]] executes [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Thrum Boska]]
        - “Suffer not the dragon to live.”
- Interlude: A meeting of dragons
    - Meeting between Jei, Nikria, and Dragon
    - Jei finds herself surrounded by smoke, barely able to see or breathe.
    - Next to her, Nikria stands, unconcerned. “Ah, Ms. Jei! I'm surprised to see you here.”
    - Deep within the smoke, a shadow moves
    - Eyes, each as large as a warrior's shield, gaze at them from above
    - “Well done, my vassals.”
    - Suspicion has been diverted, and the Ravens maintain control
    - Situation has changed; time for more aggressive measures
    - Nikria will squeeze the town, control the populace, and resume mining at all costs
    - Jei, maintain good favor with the guards of the town and the party
    - Try to dissuade from final stand - get them to run instead, or to go for help if absolutely necessary
    - “Your little knot of adventurers are touched by fate, and I am quite intrigued to see what the Weave makes of them.”
    - If Jei pushes back - a searing heat inside her chest where her heart used to be
        - “I own you, Jei. Don't you ever forget it.”
- [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]] seizing more control of [[Wake of the Dragon/Locations/Lesa]]
    - Pushes for workforce to reenter mines, despite danger - “Our anima will keep our miners safer than any normal protective detail could manage.”
        - Giving preferential treatment to those who join, but holdouts are being pushed to the back of the supply queue - food, water, medicine
    - “We’re sorry that we don’t have all we’d like to sell. It’s terribly difficult transporting these supplies safely so far, and many shipments get lost along the way. Really, if not for our anima, who knows what could happen to the trading routes!”
- Mayor Marris pushes back, beginning Ravens’ War of Attrition
    - Block supply lines
    - Block magical communication
    - Initial “negotiations” stonewalled - Ravens Guild claims they deserve more recognition and compensation for their hefty investment
    - Found Crick while there
        - Memory starting to come back, but comes and goes
        - Limited by some sort of device attached to his skull
        - Said he'd appreciate a rescue, but that would alert the Ravens immediately
    - Guardians went to demand freedom, but they never returned
    - Lesa supplies dwindling - not sure how much longer they'll last

# Scenes

- [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Marris Velka]] sees what the Ravens’ Guild are moving towards
    - Desperate for help, asked for Guardian intervention, but they are stretched too thin
    - Seems inevitable that Ravens’ Guild will aggressively negotiate better trade terms, and threaten a withdrawal of their protection otherwise.
- Marris wants to talk to Falafel
    - Fervent devotee of the Order of Eternal Flame, asking for penance and guidance
    - Thinks Falafel is a truth seeker from the Order, and that Marris is being weighed and found wanting
    - Guilty that she let the Ravens in, guilty that she has failed to live up to her family’s legacy
    - Feels obligated to stay and do her best to protect the remaining people of the town as best she can
    - “Tell me, Holy Mother - can I ever atone for failing my people so utterly?”
- [[(Formerly) Kanto]]’s escape plan
    - “From what I heard, the creepy corpse wizards have turned out to be greedy and malicious! Heavens! Who could have foreseen such a twist?”
    - Turn central tree into a gateway to Feywild
    - Takes some time
- In the Mines:
    - Miners being driven to exhaustion, not enough water or food
    - Guardian armor dumped in a side tunnel
    - Zombies and skeletons tirelessly boring through the stone
    - What are they looking for? Dragon artifact?
- Feywild
    - Emerge into a field of flowers and trees, like the site of Lesa looked like before you began to rebuild, strangely faded and distant
    - Stepping away from the tree, see that space warps and flickers - partly Faerie field, and partly rebuilt Lesa
    - In the sky, stars twinkle, though far fewer than you would normally see, and concentrated in small clusters
    - Snaking vines strike - Dryad fight!
- Dryad Fight

  

  

Fairy Queen - [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Queen of the Starry Host]]

- “Two shunned children, striving to rise above their families.”
- “Two inheritors, wrestling to define their legacy.”
- “A survivor, desperate to breathe free again.”
- “No wonder you caught the Dreamers' eye.”
