Below the surface, there is an even more frenetic pace.

- Fey bustling from room to room, calling for makeup and lines
- Janitors frantically cleaning, keeping the underground caverns pristine and smelling of flowers
- Beyond, a grand grotto full of misty waterfalls with a host of fairies casting scrying screens into the iridescent mist, tracking the movement of the stars and the performers below
