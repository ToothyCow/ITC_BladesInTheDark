### Elevator Pitch

  

### The Story So Far

Magic has always pervaded this land, manifesting in those with the natural talent or pure commitment to do so naturally and borrowed by those desperate enough to sell their souls to malevolent brokers for a bit of power. Even so, no one had seen magic wielded with such destructive fury as the Burning Horde. Ranks of spellcasters razing armies in seconds, massive beasts with impenetrable scales, empowered flames so hot it turned the ground to glass - all these horrors clearly showed that warfare had changed. All seemed lost for the United Peoples until Orelius the Seer presented his Unified Magical Theory, a series of formulae that allowed anyone with enough intellect to consistently and repeatedly harness magic, and to infuse magic into weapons, armor, and tools. All at once, the Dragons’ unstoppable march turned into a gruelling and devastating war, and to the joy of the United Peoples, the tides steadily turned until the Dragons were driven back to the frozen wastes of the North and forced to sue for peace.

  

Despite the war being won, the aftermath may prove to be even more trying.
