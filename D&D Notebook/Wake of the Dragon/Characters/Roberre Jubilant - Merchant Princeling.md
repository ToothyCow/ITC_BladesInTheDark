Inspiration: “Sarai, darling! I haven’t seen you since you joined the clergy. Is it as stuffy as I’ve heard?”, “Ah, Jared - Still an… ***ahem*** _alcohol enthusiast_, I see. Staying away from bonfires, I trust?”

Posh, lounging, _dramatic sigh_

Purpose: display the opulence and depravity of the nobility

Trait: I will seize what the nobility denies me. I will take what is rightfully mine
