Inspiration: “I am heartened to see _someone_ in this village of would-be pioneers has the sense to consult the local archives.”, “If you do manage to kill the hag, please retrieve her hands before burning the body - there are some questionable theses about hexes I would like to debunk.”

Quietly contemplative, hands folded on lap, _clicks tongue_, magic manipulation and wheelchair maneuvering

Purpose: communicate information and provide an alternative perspective

Trait: I will catalog threats and control dangerous magic with knowledge. No one else will suffer like I did if I can help it.
