# NPC
Gruff Australian
- "Don't try it, kid. You don't have a play here."
- "Stay angry, get better, and then come find me. I'm looking forward to kicking your arse again."
- "Honor is following the contract and finishing the mission. Nothing else matters, and nothing can be over the line."


# Story Link
- Famous Gnomish wandslinger. Love him or hate him, no one can deny his skill
- Knows [[Samantha Murph]] - encouraged her to go out and prove to her family that she could be a great hero with no magic whatsoever


# Motivations
- I will bring honor to the [[Wandbreakers]]. When I am hired, I will always follow through.
- I know I'm the best, but I can always be better. I am always looking for a way to hone my skills.
- I'll kill if I need to, but don't waste life. People who kill for the joy of killing disgust me.
