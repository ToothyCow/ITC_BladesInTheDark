I am a D&D 5e dungeon master who is planning a session for his players. They will take the role of guards of a magical bank, defending precious artifacts. A group of dragon cultists are planning to break in and steal the artifacts. What magical defenses are in place? What are 3 creative options for the dragon cultists to circumvent these defenses? What are 10 things that could go wrong to make the heist more complicated and interesting?
