Minister of the Treasury; glamorous halfling, loud, short, hungry for power and recognition, wants to be a hero for the people
Leans in, talks fast and forcefully, constantly dealing with interruptions so he cuts to the point as quickly as possible

Came from a low-middle class family of merchants, rose through the ranks through cutting clever dealings with the army and maintaining supply lines when other merchants folded. Hates what [[Dominus Caius]] has become, but hates the monarchy more. Desperately wants to avoid going back to noble rule, and quietly maneuvering to set up for an oligarchy of business leaders, but is worried about the growing power of the Ravens Guild

Opportunities:
- Ambitious, and loves a good deal
- Wants desperately to be known as more than a cutthroat businessman. Wants to leave the nation better than he found it, provide more upward mobility for kids like him.
- Worried about maintaining power in the face of the Ravens Guild's ambitions

Pitfalls:
- Hates nobles that haven't earned their place
- Hates complacency and the way things used to be. We don't need to go back - we need to move forward.
