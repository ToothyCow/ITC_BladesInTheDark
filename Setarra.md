*Quick RP Descriptors - posture, voice/speech patterns, gestures*
- Setarra and [[Lord Scurlock]] were lovers once. She preserved his spirit to be with her forever, but his hunger for vengeance was too great, and he became a vampire to wage a one-man war against the Skov royal family.
- Setarra's sustaining of Lord Scurlock has linked their souls together, and prevented them from taking direct action against one another. They both resent each other with vitriol.
