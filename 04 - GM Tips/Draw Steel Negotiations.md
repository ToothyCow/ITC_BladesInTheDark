ATTITUDE / INTEREST / PATIENCE
Hostile / 1 / 2
Suspicious / 2 / 2
Neutral / 2 / 3
Open / 3 / 3
Friendly / 3 / 4
Trusting / 3 / 5

These are Matt Colville's negotiation rules; it's an intuitive framework which facilitates meaningful roleplay in high-stakes conversations, and I'm converting it to D&D 5th Edition.   

So if high-stakes roleplaying scenes make you feel stressed, check this out.

# When to use these rules 

Not every social interaction is a negotiation; these rules are for high-stakes conversations where the party has a clear, plausible request, where an NPC must have an interest in negotiating with the heroes—but must also have a reason to not simply jump on board with whatever the heroes propose.

But we're not replacing regular roleplaying! If the players want to interrogate a goblin about the whereabouts of his lair, that's your standard Intimidation check. Or if the players want to flirt with a wizard to get a better price on a Scroll of Subscribe YouTuber, that's a your standard Persuasion check.

The important part is: the party needs to come into a situation with a clear, plausible request. In fact, you should make the party write down that request. 

- "Princess, we believe your advisor is secretly a villain — arrest them at once!"
- "Luke, the five of us are your father! Join the dark side!"
- "Honey, this game isn't just for nerds. Come play a one-shot, you'll love it."

But it has to be a PLAUSABLE request; you cannot convince an NPC to do something that is out of character. Here's the paragraph from the PDF which got me excited about these rules:

    Negotiation is not a process that changes an NPC’s character. Rather, the heroes are trying to make an NPC understand how behaving differently would be in character.

Pretty cool!

# Interest and Patience

During the negotiation, the NPC has two stats: interest and patience. This is your first job: you need to set these two values at the start of the negotiation.

Interest is measure of how willing the NPC is to grant party's request. This number goes up and down throughout the negotiation depending on player actions. If their Interest reaches the maximum value of 5, the negotiation ends because the NPC 100% agrees with the players and they make their final offer to the party.

Patience is a measure of how willing the NPC is to have this conversation. This number ONLY goes down throughout the negotiation. If their Patience reaches zero, they make their final offer to the party, and that offer is determined by where the NPC's Interest is at that moment.

So when you're setting those two initial values, you need to look at circumstances the players are walking into. What is the starting attitude of the NPC?

ATTITUDE / INTEREST / PATIENCE
Hostile / 1 / 2
Suspicious / 2 / 2
Neutral / 2 / 3
Open / 3 / 3
Friendly / 3 / 4
Trusting / 3 / 5

Here we are again: Friendly, Hostile, Neutral. So you can see: if the NPC trusts the party, the negotiation's starting Interest and Patience values are higher (which is good).

But here's some situational considerations:

If you think the players are coming into this with an extremely bad reputation, you can lower the NPC's Interest by 1.

On the other hand, if the players have an extremely good reputation, you can increase the NPC's Patience by 1, to a max of 5.

And pay attention to the NPC's native language (not including Common). If one player speaks that native language, the NPC’s Patience increases by 1. If three players speak that language, the NPC’s patience increases by 2. Remember, Patience has a max of 5.
Outcomes of the negotiation

The final outcome of this negotiation is the offer the NPC is willing make to the party. There are six possible outcomes, each tethered to the NPC's current Interest level, ranging zero to five. 

INTEREST / OUTCOME
0 / No, and something bad... 
1 / No...
2 / No, but something good...
3 / Yes, but something bad...
4 / Yes...
5 / Yes, and something good...

This is where you refer back to the party's request: you did write it down, didn't you? Some of you may be comfortable improvising this outcome at the table, and some of you will want to know the party's request ahead of time and prepare each outcome.

As an example, let's take a look at this request: "Princess, we believe your advisor is secretly a villain — arrest them at once!"

0 Interest: No, and... No, the challenge to the advisor's loyalty only cements the Princess's trust in her advisor. And, the Princess is insulted and expels the party from her underwater castle immediately. If they can't teleport, they swim.

1 Interest: No... No, the challenge to the advisor's loyalty only cements the Princess's trust in her advisor.

2 Interest: No, but... No, the challenge to the advisor's loyalty only cements the Princess's trust in her advisor. But, if the players insist on meddling in giant affairs, they should start by investigating her missing father's whereabouts. The Princess gives them a clue.

3 Interest: Yes, but... Yes, the Princess agrees that her advisor's activity warrants investigation. But, it's too much to arrest her advisor, so instead, the advisor will be barred from royal service while the investigation is underway.

4 Interest: Yes... Yes, The Princess agrees that her advisor's activity warrants investigation, so the advisor will be confined to quarters immediately.

5 Interest: Yes, and... Yes, the Princess agrees that her advisor's activity warrants investigation, so the advisor will be confined to quarters immediately. And, for sparing her court from further deception, the Princess rewards the players with 1 item from the Very Rare Armaments table in the new DMG.

Even separate from the full negotiations rules, this table ALONE has been extremely helpful to me. Sometimes when I'm improvising during regular roleplay, I'll roll a D6-1 to determine where an NPC's current interest is, and I'll shift the dice up or down depending on how well the players do. 

# Motivations and Pitfalls

This is your second job: you need to choose which arguments will be affecting on this NPC's personality, because every negotiation scene is unique depending on the personalities involved. Matt Colville mechanizes the NPC's personality in negotiations through traits called Motivations and Pitfalls. In my experience, the sweet spot for each negotiation is three Motivations and two Pitfalls, so that's what you should aim for. 

A Motivation is a core belief the NPC has, so if the party appeals to that belief, they can expect a better outcome. 

A Pitfall is the opposite, though: it's a value which the NPC would be insulted to have attributed to them.

Draw Steel gives us 12 [[Negotiation Personality Traits]] to choose from, but you can totally make your own if you feel like these words don't encompass your NPC. 

    Benevolence

    Discovery

    Freedom

    Greed

    Higher Authority

    Justice

    Legacy

    Peace

    Power

    Protection

    Revelry

    Vengeance

Player actions during a negotiation

At this point, if you've set the NPC's starting attitude, and you've written down their motivations and pitfalls, your last job is to actually run the negotiation.

Thankfully, that's the easiest part, because the players have to do all the work.

So let's talk about the player's options are during a negotiation. If you send this video to the players, this is probably the only section they need to watch. It's totally OK for the players to know all the other information too, these rules aren't secret, but I know the players haven't read the Player's Handbook, they don't own their own dice: expecting them to watch a whole video longer than five minutes is asking too much, I get it.

So: hello players! Hi! In this negotiation, we'll be asking you to make Persuasion, Intimidation, or Deception checks. Whenever you make one of these rolls, there are three possible bands of outcome. 

    The first band is 11 or lower, which is is a failure.

    The second band is 12 or more, which is a partial failure or partial success.

    The third band is 17 or more, which is a success.

During a negotiation, you have three options:

    Get a read on the NPC

    Make an argument

    Accept an offer

And just to make this easier to follow, remember: Interest is how willing this NPC is to grant the party's request, and Patience is how willing the NPC is to have this conversation. Both range from zero to five.

Get a read on them: Make an Insight check! If you fail, the NPC's Interest goes down. If you succeed, you learn something about their Motivations or Pitfalls.

    Failure: The NPC realizes the party is trying to read them and becomes annoyed. Their Patience is reduced by 1.

    DC12 Partial Failure: The NPC is hard to read!

    DC17 Success: The party learns one of the NPC's Motivations or Pitfalls (player's choice).

Make an argument: Whenever you make an argument, you're rolling a Persuasion check or an Intimidation check, but sometimes you're making a Deception check instead. As the conversation moves forward and your party says what they say, the Dungeon Master decides which Motivations the party is appealing to and that determines which table the party rolls on.

The Dungeon master will ask themselves:

    Is the party appealing to a Motivation?

    Is the party appealing to a Pitfall?

    Is the party appealing to neither a Motivation nor a Pitfall?

    Is the party telling a lie?

If your group is having trouble placing the party's argument into one of these four options, you can always ask questions, maybe zoom out of the in-game roleplaying to have a meta  clarifying conversation if needed.

Appeal to a Motivation: When the party appeals to a motivation, they have the chance to get the BEST results. The consequences of failing aren't as bad, and the reward for succeeding is HUGE: you can increase their Interest WITHOUT reducing their Patience. Each motivation can be successfully appealed to only once during a negotiation.

    Failure: The NPC’s Patience decreases by 1.

    DC12 Partial Success: The NPC’s Interest increases by 1, and their Patience decreases by 1.

    DC17 Success: The NPC’s Interest increases by 1.

Appeal to a Pitfall: When the party accidentally appeals to a Pitfall, the argument automatically fails! So the NPC’s Interest and Patience each decrease by 1.

Appeal to neither a Motivation nor a Pitfall: Sometimes an argument doesn't appeal to either a Motivation OR a Pitfall, or maybe it doesn't even appeal to anything on the list at all. That's OK! In that case, we use this table where the only good result is third band. 

    Failure: The NPC’s Interest and Patience each decrease by 1.

    DC12 Partial Failure: The NPC’s Patience decreases by 1.

    DC17 Success: The NPC’s Interest increases by 1, and their Patience decreases by 1.

Tell a lie: Sometimes the party is lying! In any instance where the party would normally make a Persuasion or Intimidation check, they can make a Deception check instead. BUT if they don't succeed the roll, the NPC catches the lie and gets offended. And this effect STACKS with whatever the consequence of failing on that table is.

Accept an offer: And finally, the players can ask the NPC to make an offer, and that offer is determined by their current Interest level.
Making it work

You can learn this system to a point where you can generate a Negotiation scene on-the-fly. Do your first job by rolling for a random starting attitude, do your second job by rolling for random motivations and pitfalls, then do your third job by running the scene and handing the players this handout to track the negotiations progress.

But, you may have to practice the system first. Think back to how did you learn to run combat in D&D? If you're like me, you probably set up a mock-combat by yourself, opened up the rulebook, and spent an hour just playing it out. That's what you should do to practice these negotiation rules.
