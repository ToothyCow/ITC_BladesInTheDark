# Description
The Song of Flame is a magical phenomena, an urge to tap deeper into the source of draconic magic. This source is incredible powerful, volatile, and corrupting.

# Mechanics
- Corruption
	- Level 1-10
	- Add 2x corruption level to elemental damage
	- Roll 1d10 - if equal or lower, compelled to grow in power. Corruption increases by 1. Kill sentient or magical creatures until total level is greater than your corruption level. Take trophies, bask in the glow of the flame
	- Will save to resist. If ignored for 24 hours, 1 level of exhaustion
