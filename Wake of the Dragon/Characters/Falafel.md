Former noble. Unsure of what happened to her parents, but she was raised in the palace. While snooping, she discovered a dragon cult operating in the palace, and that the king, her grandfather, was involved. She escaped without being noticed (as far as she knows), and joined the clergy to escape gracefully.

Brother: [[Incense]]
Order: [[Weeping Phoenix]]

She was a very dutiful child, who was drawn to religion at an early age. She served as the well-meaning oldest child of the royal children


- She is a Light Cleric, and therefore associated with the Guardians  (haven't determined a name for the Cleric Order yet - considering "Order of Holy Fire"?)
- She is a descendant of the deposed monarch, and has a claim to the throne. Who else knows this? Is your Cleric Order supporting you?
- She isn't super comfortable with authority or the spotlight yet. How does she feel about her claim to the throne? Does she want to rule?

Other questions:
- You've discussed her possibly being a counter-phobic Enneagram 6. Does this come from being in hiding and under threat from the day she was born? Who have you decided to trust, and who are you still suspicious of?
- What does Falafel want, and does she have a plan to get it?

No rush on any of this - just wanted a central place to discuss it.
