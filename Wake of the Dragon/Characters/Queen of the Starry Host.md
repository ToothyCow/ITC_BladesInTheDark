A Fae Queen, desperate to preserve her peoples’ power

Producer Mode: Urgent, Intense Stare. "We have 15 seconds to talk. You want this, I want this. How can we make this happen?"
Dramatic Matriarch Mode: Lounging, ”Haaaahhhh…”. "Dears, I applaud your bravery, but I must say, your wisdom is rather lacking."

- Court: Autumn
- Motivation: My people are fading, and if nothing is done, they will starve. I must regain the favor of the Dreamers, and I will seize any opportunity to regain the Story.
- Obstacles: The party is “too important”
- Incentives: Can tie the Fae Story to the PCs, and maybe steal the Story altogether
