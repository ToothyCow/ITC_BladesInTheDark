Raven’s Guildmaster

  

Inspiration: “I fully admit our new technology has horrendous optics - it is a known design flaw, and we are actively working on it. Still, the the fundamental tech is sound, and incredibly useful.”, “How are you enjoying the gala? We spared no expense - only the best for the heroes of Lesa!”

  

Pleasantly austere, exaggerated gestures, “Ah-haaa”

Purpose: Provide convenience, wield influence

Trait: The time of nations is coming to an end. The Raven’s Guild will be the next major world power, and [[Wake of the Dragon/Locations/Lesa]] will be the first step on our path to greatness.
