**1/day, a creature may blow the horn to use Dance Tune:** Each humanoid, fey, or giant within 30 feet that can hear the horn makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure it must dance until the beginning of the user’s next turn. While dancing its movement speed is halved and it has disadvantage on attack rolls. Allies (specified by the user’s intention) don’t suffer the negative consequences of dancing. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it it is immune to any satyrs Dance Tune for 24 hours. This is a magical charm effect.
