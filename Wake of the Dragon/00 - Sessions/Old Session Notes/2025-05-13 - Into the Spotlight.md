### Entering [[Voxfell - Fey Frontier Town]]

- Background: 
- Greeted by guards at the city gates - “Prince Kanto! It is good to see you survived your foray into the mortal plane. The Queen has asked to see you as soon as you returned.”
- Escorted through the city streets - SEE DESCRIPTION [[Voxfell - Fey Frontier Town]]
- ***Perception*** - DC20
	- Success: You notice one of the guards casually place a hand on Kanto's back, then do a series of subtle hand signs. Nearly imperceptibly, Kanto stiffens, but does not change his attitude or speech
- As you near the palace, you approach a covered archway.
	- Kanto - "I have to tell you, Jobry, it is good to be back."
	- "It's good to have you back, sire."
	- With no warning, the guard slams a black hood over Kanto's head, and together they dive forward into a trapdoor under an arch

### Entering [[Voxfell - Backstage]]

- SEE DESCRIPTION
- As soon as [[Jei Malva]] drops through the trapdoor, she feels her Patron’s power cut off, and goes into cardiac arrest
- A regal Fey in a faintly glowing black dress runs over to check.

### Jei Vision

Sounds:
- [Mirror of Dreams](https://open.spotify.com/track/3aAdFbEcYZrYXuy7bhil2k?si=gMpnszN4RbCrk4Bh50hFlQ)

Scene
- The regal Fey makes a face, says "Bah... [[Chimess]]", but she composes herself as she gently touches your collarbone
- The pain in your chest suddenly vanishes, and you find yourself standing upon an endless lake, its surface as still as glass, water gently rippling at your feet
- You are wearing the same black glittering gown the regal Fey was wearing
- In the sky above are thousands of stars, watching expectantly
- **PERFORMANCE DC17**:
    - Success: You dance as you've never danced before, and the stars blaze bright. You drink in their light, their praise, their Gaze. As your performance comes to an end, you bow gracefully, and feel your body thrum with power. You are art personified, and you will never die.
    - Failure: You dance with power and grace, but within seconds you know it's not enough. Despite your best efforts, the stars start to fade, their Gaze moving elsewhere. Desperately, you drink up all the light you can, but as your performance ends and you take your bow, the light is fading. You did not gain enough power, and your people will go hungry.

### Speaking with [[Queen of the Starry Host]]

> - “Two shunned children, striving to grow beyond their families.”
> - “Two inheritors of power and glory, wrestling to define their legacy.”
> - “A survivor, desperate to breathe free again.”
> - “No wonder you caught the Gaze.”

- High level: she wants to get them where they want to go, as long as they're willing to bring a Dreamcatcher along. However, negotiations are dramatic, and they never waste drama.
- incentives and conflicts - see encounter
- Jei - as you emerge from Backstage, you feel your patron’s power flooding back in, and pushing up against the power of the Gaze within you. For the time being, you feel what it would be like to have the power without the threats of the dragon.


### **Encounter** - [[Negotiation - Queen of the Starry Host]]


### Post-Negotiation Ball
- the Queen follows up:
    - Jei: “Tell [[Chimess]] that if she sends any more of her little pets to spy on me, I will return their heads with apples in their mouths.”
        - “Ah… She didn't know you were coming here, did she? Do you want out?”
        - “I don't have the power to spare to break this kind of pact, but I have a… business associate who may be of interest to you. If you agree to tell my story in 7 taverns in the next 7 months, I will give you a letter of recommendation.”
    - Falafel: “You are playing a dangerous game, aren't you? Do you think you stand a chance, a lone sapling facing down a hurricane?”
    - Tao: “Now, you are an oddity - Dragonspawn without Draconic taint. Beware of the song of flame - dragonfire is powerful, intoxicating, but it will burn away all that you are, leaving only naked ambition, hatred, and spite.”
    - Samantha: “You're one of the Murphisonian clan, are you not?”
        - “Oh, you are Dorald’s granddaughter??? Moon and stars, that is fantastic! Do tell him that if he gets tired of tinkering with space and time, we would always welcome more of his sculptures.”
- Gateway to [[Blazing Bekai]]
