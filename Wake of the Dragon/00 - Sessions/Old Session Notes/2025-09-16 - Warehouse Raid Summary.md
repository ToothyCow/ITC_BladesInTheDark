	- Says she will have the freedom to choose to serve him, or to walk away
	- Gives assistance in raiding warehouse, rescuing [[Tao Xiloscient]]
- Warehouse raid successful
	- Some magical artifacts destroyed
	- Tao starting to succumb to the Song of Flame, earning 2 Corruption Points
- Djinni Council refused to offer aid to party for free
	- Ihaiir advocated for you, but since multiple members are guardians and at least one has dragon taint, they view you as being involved in the inland war, and don't want any part of it
	- Willing to offer you transport to [[Ariosa City]] as payment for a job
	- Work with the Djinni to stop the next heist by the Seekers of the Flame
