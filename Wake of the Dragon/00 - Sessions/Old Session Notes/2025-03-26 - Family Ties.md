- Tried to negotiate with [[Crick]], but failed - fought and won, Crick requested that they leave the 3 skeletons and 1 zombie alone
- Hag saw what they did - goat eye in the wall
- [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Jei Malva]] succeeded in touching the skull - the Dragon is pleased
- Got back to town, [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Carwin Steeljaw - Guardian Knight]] checked in, escorted them back to [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]], who fulfilled his end of the bargain
- [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Samantha Murph]] overheard [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Thrum Boska]] threaten [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Marris Velka]] about Raven's Guild’s power
- [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Jei Malva]] and [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Tao Xiloscient]] encountered the Murphies, a grieving widow who accused the Raven's Guild of stealing her husband's body and forging a contract
    - Contract seems legit
    - Ryder Murphie asphyxiated in his sleep
    - Investigation showed that a viral fungus grew in his throat - it exploded and almost killed the receptionist and [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Tao Xiloscient]]
- [[Falafel]] went with [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Carwin Steeljaw - Guardian Knight]] to the [[Wake of the Dragon/Locations/Guardian Archives - Lesa]] to investigate hags, found poem - [[02 - Monsters/Monster Shortlist/Green Hag]]
- [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Jared the Jester (Jubilant)]] talked with [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Thrum Boska]]
    - Same time as [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Samantha Murph]] overhearing with [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Marris Velka]]
    - [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Thrum Boska]] resentful that he's viewed as a leech, when all he did was try to help the town
    - Further, angry that everyone loves [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]], all because “he knows a dragon”
    - Overstepped, makes [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Jared the Jester (Jubilant)]] promise not to say anything
- Raven's Guild promised reward for retrieving Crick - arriving with merchant caravan
- Merchants arrive, led by [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Roberre Jubilant - Merchant Princeling]]

# Strong Start

- Talk with [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Roberre Jubilant - Merchant Princeling]]
    - Opportunity to make quite a bit of coin selling goods to [[Wake of the Dragon/Locations/Lesa]], particularly weapons and anti-fey charms
    - "You know, Jared, you could be amazing at anything you wanted to try, and it is just depressing that you’re so determined to be an amazing waste of talent.”
    - “If you had an ounce of courage, you would stand up to Father, or make something new, but you’re too afraid to try.”
- Magic items:
    - Bag of Holding

# Scenes

- Interrogate [[(Formerly) Kanto]]
    - “Greetings, my captors! I trust the ransom negotiations are going well?” … “She, uh… she hasn't responded at all?”
    - Goals: figure out his role in this new story, get freed from jail
    - Problem: He’s really proud of his moves against [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Mother Deera]]
        - She had a long con against several high-ranking members of Unseelie Court
        - He casually dropped a bombshell secret at a dinner party after pretending to be Geas’d
        - Fallout of that rippled through fey courts, got her expelled from her coven
- Hag tricks/curses:
    - Find eyes and ears where they shouldn't be
        - Crops
        - Buildings/furniture
        - People
    - If left unaddressed:
        - Curse water supply - using names and titles causes 1 point of damage
        - Crops begin to cause disease - mushrooms growing rampant
    - Replace NPC with changeling, 1/month - who?
        - Ryder Murphie - Farmer
- Trapping the Hag
    - [[02 - Monsters/Monster Shortlist/Green Hag]] is coming into town every night
    - Next goal: sort through [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]] room, look for/concoct something to damage reputation
    - Complication: [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]] has an amulet of truesight. He'll raise the alarm
- Hunting the Hag
    - [[02 - Monsters/Monster Shortlist/Green Hag]] hut is part of a dam in the middle of a poisonous bog
    - She will see them coming, barring superb plan
    - Goal: cause havoc, plant seed of doubt, dip
- [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Thrum Boska]] accused of dragon worship
    - Evidence:
        - letters to and from known dragon cult members hidden within belongings, hastily edited to appear to implicate [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]]
        - confessions from captured cult members
        - Warlock’s Dragon Totem - +1, maximize 7
    - Result: [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Carwin Steeljaw - Guardian Knight]] executes [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Thrum Boska]]
        - “Suffer not the dragon to live.”
