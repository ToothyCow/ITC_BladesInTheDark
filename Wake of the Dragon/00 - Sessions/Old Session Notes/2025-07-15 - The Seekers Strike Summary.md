# Session Notes
- Falafel and Tao spotted the Seekers
- Group tried to shake the pursuers, but the seekers firebombed a cart
- Rudy joined the fight, but the Seekers took Tao
- Jei tried to help, but Patron forbade her. She fought against her patron's influence to defend her friends, and sent Mine to follow Seekers
- Tao agreed to go quietly if the rest of the Seekers left her friends alone
- Group A (Falafel and Rudy) followed Mine to see where the Seekers were taking Tao, while Group B (Jared, Samantha, and Jei) went to Ihaiir
- Group B admitted to see Ihaiir with no issue, but he does confirm he knows they have a connection to [[Chimess]]. He says he would kill them where they stood, if not for the Fey Queen's letter. He asks the group for their story, and Jei obliges, only to feel her patron start to inflict a heart attack.
- Group A successfully follows Mine to a warehouse. Inside, Tao has the bag pulled from her head. She is tied to a chair, surrounded by cultists, facing a young, very angry red dragon.
	- The dragon asks "You haven't even begun to hear the Song?"
	- Says he hates Tao for having all this power handed to her, free of effort, by a thief
	- Wants to take back what was stolen, but needs to awaken it first, lest it be lost.
	- The cultists begin to sing, and Tao feels the song echo in her soul.
