- Met [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]]
    - He took captured satyr [[Murphred (Formerly Kanto)]] and awaits ransom note
    - [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Marris Velka]] insisted the satyr be kept in the town jail, not in Raven’s Guild territory
- Months pass, food supplies dwindle
    - Supernaturally hungry beast scouring the nearby forest
    - Caravan supplies running low, being supplemented by Raven’s Guild supply lines
    - [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Carwin Steeljaw - Guardian Knight]] and [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Marris Velka]] want to prioritize killing the beast
    - [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]] says that alone won’t solve the problem - much damage has already been done to the surrounding habitat
        - Clear goblin tribe out of local mine, retrieve proprietary RG property
        - Proposes an alternative - provide incentive for Raven’s Guild to increase supply lines
    - Party decided to do both, luring the bear to the mine and try to get them to fight each other
- Hunt for the Bear
    - Tracked it, then it started tracking them
    - Ran for the mine, spooked the goblins
    - Ran into Goblin traps on the way, found goblin cleric with several scouts
    - Killed bear, sparred with Goblins until [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Samantha Murph]] intimidated them
- Cracked open the magical seals on the deepest room of the mine, to see a bunch of goblin and human zombies and skeletons, with one tall skeleton exclaiming with joy

# Strong Start

Confront [[Crick]]

# Scenes

- Skeleton negotiation/fight
- Eyes in the trees
- Deal with Raven’s Guild - Options:
    - Turn Crick over - solid food supply for town
    - Couldn’t find anything - maybe food supply, maybe resentment, depending on party actions
    - Confront about Crick/sentient undead - complete denial. Sophisticated magical imprints resulting in artificial intelligence - no way they can actually think. Longer they go without maintenance, the more they diverge from proper functioning
- Merchants arrive
    - [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Roberre Jubilant - Merchant Princeling]]
- Research on Hags:
    - Check out [[Wake of the Dragon/Locations/Guardian Archives - Lesa]]
    - Interrogate [[Murphred (Formerly Kanto)]]
    - Search the woods for magical influence
- Interrogate [[Murphred (Formerly Kanto)]]?
    - “I trust the ransom negotiations are going well?” … “She, uh… she hasn't responded at all?”
    - Goals: figure out his role in this new story, get freed from jail
    - Problem: He’s really proud of his moves against [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Mother Deera]]
        - She had a long con against several high-ranking members of Unseelie Court
        - He casually dropped a bombshell secret at a dinner party after pretending to be Geas’d
        - Fallout of that rippled through fey courts, got her expelled from her coven
- Hag tricks/curses:
    - Have [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Thrum Boska]] suggest to [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Carwin Steeljaw - Guardian Knight]] or a PC that the Raven’s Guild may be willing to take the town by force, if their needs aren’t met
    - Poison water supply - dead goblin, committed suicide
    - Have farmer sell his body to Raven’s Guild posthumously, then have him die in his sleep, with the money nowhere to be found. Family demands his body back, but the guild refuses to budge on the contract
    - Find eyes and ears where they shouldn't be

# Monsters

_Calculate the [lazy encounter benchmark](https://slyflourish.com/the_lazy_encounter_benchmark.html) by adding together all character levels and dividing by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level or 2 if they’re 5th level or above. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than this number._
