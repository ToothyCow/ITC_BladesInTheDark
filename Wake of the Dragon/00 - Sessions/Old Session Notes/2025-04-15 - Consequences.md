    - See who freaks

- [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Thrum Boska]] - ??Ally?? - Raven’s Journeyman
- [[Murphred (Formerly Kanto)]] - ??Ally?? - Satyr, the Beguiling Song

# Scenes

- [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]] thanks party for coming to his aid
    - Concerned about what the hag was trying to do
    - Clearly sowing discontent - planting letter?
- [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Marris Velka]] sees what the Ravens’ Guild are moving towards
    - follow up with Falafel?
    - Wrestling with feeling doomed to fail her family’s legacy
    - Desperate for help, asked for Guardian intervention, but they are stretched too thin
    - Seems inevitable that Ravens’ Guild will aggressively negotiate better trade terms, and threaten a withdrawal of their protection otherwise.
- [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Thrum Boska]] accused of dragon worship
    - Evidence:
        - letters to and from known dragon cult members hidden within belongings, hastily edited to appear to implicate [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]]
        - confessions from captured cult members
        - Warlock’s Dragon Totem - +1, maximize 3 dmg dice
    - Result: [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Carwin Steeljaw - Guardian Knight]] executes [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Thrum Boska]]
        - “Suffer not the dragon to live.”
- Interlude: A meeting of dragons
    - Meeting between Jei, Nikria, and Dragon
    - Jei finds herself surrounded by smoke, barely able to see or breathe.
    - Next to her, Nikria stands, unconcerned. “Ah, Ms. Jei! I'm surprised to see you here.”
    - Deep within the smoke, a shadow moves
    - Eyes, each as large as a warrior's shield, gaze at them from above
    - “Well done, my vassals.”
    - Suspicion has been diverted, and the Ravens maintain control
    - Situation has changed; time for more aggressive measures
    - Nikria will squeeze the town, control the populace, and resume mining at all costs
    - Jei, maintain good favor with the guards of the town and the party
    - Try to dissuade from final stand - get them to run instead, or to go for help if absolutely necessary
    - “Your little knot of adventurers are touched by fate, and I am quite intrigued to see what the Weave makes of them.”
    - If Jei pushes back - a searing heat inside her chest where her heart used to be
        - “I own you, Jei. Don't you ever forget it.”
- [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]] seizing more control of [[Wake of the Dragon/Locations/Lesa]]
    - Pushes for workforce to reenter mines, despite danger - “Our anima will keep our miners safer than any normal protective detail could manage.”
        - Giving preferential treatment to those who join, but holdouts are being pushed to the back of the supply queue - food, water, medicine
    - If challenged - “We’re sorry that we don’t have all we’d like to sell. It’s terribly difficult transporting these supplies safely so far, and many shipments get lost along the way. Really, if not for our anima, who knows what could happen to the trading routes!”
    - If really challenged - blockade the town, demand capitulation
- Ravens’ War of Attrition
    - Block supply lines
    - Magicly block communication
    - Guardians who go to negotiate are killed
- [[Murphred (Formerly Kanto)]]’s escape plan
