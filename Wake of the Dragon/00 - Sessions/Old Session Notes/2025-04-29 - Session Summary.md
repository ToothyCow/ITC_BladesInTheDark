- Ravens’ War of Attrition
    - Block supply lines
    - Block magical communication
    - Guardians went to demand freedom, but they never returned
    - Lesa supplies dwindling - not sure how much longer they'll last
- Marris talks to Falafel
    - Asking for penance and guidance
    - Thinks Falafel is a truth seeker from the Order, and that Marris is being weighed and found wanting
    - Guilty that she let the Ravens in, guilty that she has failed to live up to her family’s legacy
    - “Tell me, Holy Mother - can I ever atone for failing my people so utterly?”
    - Falafel comes clean, Marris embarrassed, still asks for advice
- [[Murphred (Formerly Kanto)]]’s escape plan
    - Turn central tree into a gateway to Feywild, Takes some time
    - Asks for a good word to his mother, [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Queen of the Starry Host]]
- In the Mines:
    - Miners being driven to exhaustion, not enough water or food
    - Got Crick out and free
- Into the Feywild
    - Emerge into a field of flowers and trees, like the site of Lesa looked like before you began to rebuild, strangely faded and distant
    - Stepping away from the tree, see that space warps and flickers - partly Faerie field, and partly rebuilt Lesa
    - In the sky, stars twinkle, though far fewer than you would normally see, and concentrated in small clusters
    - Snaking vines strike - Dryads appear!
