Recap

[[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Nikria Therasan]]

- Intro - brought in on palanquin carried by massive undead
- Congratulate town on establishing partnership
- Try to seize the Satyr

# Scenes

- Interrogate [[Murphred (Formerly Kanto)]]
- Downtime - Tavern
    - Meet [[Wallawallawushka “Walla” - Tavern Owner]]
    - [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Marris Velka]] owes [[Wake of the Dragon/Characters/Jared the Jester (Jubilant)]] a drink
- See Ravens getting more set up in town
    - Guild Hall established with undead guards
    - Dispute between grieving family and guild technicians claiming the body
- Idea: hunt for the Great Bear
    - Hunting has been even worse since the Satyr attack
    - Scouts report orchards stripped clean, whole herds of deer mauled and eaten
    - Something big is stalking the forest and will likely choke out the city's food supply
    - Key hunting scenes:
        - Attacked by starving wolves - one heavily mauled already
        - party finds tracks, follows them, only to have the tracks loop around- the bear is hunting them
        - party laser trap for the bear
        - party finds the bears den
    - Final discovery - Fae-enchanted, possibly the work of a hag
- Idea: root out the hidden threat in the mines
    - The Ravens Guild offers to create a line of trade to bring supplies into the city
    - In exchange, they want the party to clear out an old stone mine that has been infested with Goblins, and ask for recovery of their special research materials
    - Key scenes:
        - Sneak up on entrance to mine - Goblin scouts/guards
        - Goblin Lair is full of traps, but many are facing in instead of out. Goblin habitation looks much bigger than the actual number of goblins
        - Fight with Goblin Warlock - seems to be attempting a ritual
        - Find a sealed-off tunnel - Don't Open, Angry Dead

# Monsters

_Calculate the [lazy encounter benchmark](https://slyflourish.com/the_lazy_encounter_benchmark.html) by adding together all character levels and dividing by 4 if they're 1st to 4th level or 2 if they’re 5th level or above. An encounter may be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than this number._
