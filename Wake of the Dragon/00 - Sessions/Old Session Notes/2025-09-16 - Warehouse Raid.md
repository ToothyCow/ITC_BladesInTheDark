# Scenes

### *Strong Start -  A Meeting with a Djinni - [[Ihaiir]]
- [[Chimess]] speaks to [[Tao Xiloscient]]
	- "You dare to think you could be free of me? And you really thought a Djinn would help you? They are selfish, greedy, and cruel, but not half as cruel as me. Your life is mine, and I will end it now."
- As your vision tunnels, you feel an impact and a ripping pain in your chest, followed by a gentle warmth. As your consciousness returns, you note that the skin over your heart has crystallized. Ihaiir stands over you, the remnants of his spell lingering in the air, and offers you a hand to help you to your feet, then glances up at what appears to be a scrying sensor. He flips a middle finger, then makes a cutting motion, severing the connection.
- "I may be selfish, greedy, and cruel, but she forgot to mention spiteful. She is a fool to think I wouldn't take the opportunity to rob her of even a fraction of her power."


### Encounter: [[Warehouse Raid]]


### Djinni Court Complications
- Ihaiir speaks for the Djinn of Earth - wants to reward the party with a boon
- Fire is against it, claiming Guardians in the party. Air is in favor, claiming garnering favor with the Guardians may be in their best interests. Fire argues they would be best served by leaving Ariosan politics to the Ariosans, and prioritize business
- Water chimes in with a compromise - engage the party in a profitable venture, earn passage. No favoritism shown, just a job being done
- Choice - catch magical artifact thieves, or compete in Bulette races and defeat the reigning champion

### Interlude - Places of Magic and Wonder
- You are on the Djinni payroll, at least for the time being. This gives you access to many of the more exclusive clubs and shops of the city, all at a reasonable discount.
- Shops: Magical Items (Armor?)
- Clubs: Music, Gambling, Drinks
