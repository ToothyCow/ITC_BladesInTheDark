# Scenes

### *Strong Start -  An Offer of Employment*
- [[Jei Malva]] wakes up with [[Mine]] coiled on her stomach like a cat, standing guard
- Ihaiir - "I see you're made of strong stuff indeed."
	- References conversation with [[Chimess]] - See [[2025-09-16 - Warehouse Raid]]
- Offers employment, not servitude
- Oaths:
	- "I shall free those unjustly held captive wherever I go. I will never help a slaver except as a means to free the enslaved."
	- "I shall seek to acquire the vessels of any djinn held in captivity, whether justly or not, and return them to the Djinn Collective."
	- "I shall never knowingly work against the interests of the Djinn Collective, except as a means to expose the enemies of the Djinn Collective."
	- "I shall pay 35% of my earnings in all my endeavors to my patron."
		- If she seems to accept without a second thought - "Pause, Jei. A lesson for you - numbers must always be in conversation with each other. 50% is far too high for someone of your unique skillset. Try a counter offer."

### Vault Heist Aftermath
- Djinn are in awe that you killed a juvenile dragon
- [[Seekers of the Flame]] stole 4 wishes in the tumult, but quite low value - impossible wishes that could not be cast 
	- a wish for the undying love of a wayward daughter
	- a wish to dominate all life on the planet
	- a wish for the forgiveness of a deity
	- a wish for everyone to agree to their requests.
- Magic cannot permanently alter any soul, either mortal or divine, except that of the wisher.
- [[Tao Xiloscient]] has noticeable corruption now
	- She has "fed" recently, but the hunger will continue to grow
	- If she "ascends" (corruption level 7), she will begin to transform into a dragon, and the Guardians will undoubtedly seek to kill her
- Party rewarded with transport - their own airship

### To [[Ariosa City]]

### Entrance
- Setting:
	- As you approach the city, the first thing you see are the walls, towering into the sky
	- Glow with a prismatic energy, fluctuating between colors
	- Armed with ballista aimed at the sky
	- Towers of the Guardian Orders stab defiantly into the sky
	- Onyx Palace stands in the center
- Sneak through checkpoints to enter the city
	- Golems at every gate
	- Soldiers with magitech spears, spellslingers, armor with eyes of hellfire
	- Dragon-blood sensing glyphs

### Meet up with [[Weeping Phoenix]]
- A cramped, musty apartment building in the bad part of the city
- Inside the apartment, clean air, subtle incense, gentle candles, beautiful tapestries
- Main room dominated by a large table, currently with a map of the city rolled out on it
- Standing around it are several guardians, merchants, and even some guardsmen.
- Among them stands a slight tiefling, with purple skin and horns. He wears ornate robes, and has a book on a chain hanging from his belt.
