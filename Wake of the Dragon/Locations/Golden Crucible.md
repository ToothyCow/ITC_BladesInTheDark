Description:
- A golden sign, flickering with illusory flames. There's nothing illusory about the heat blasting out from the doorway - you can feel it from several paces away, even in the hot desert sun
- Inside, apprentices of all races dash around the room as whispers rush throughout 
- You see one apprentice holding a glowing jar, seeming to gather some of the whispers into a concentrated form before pouring a silvery substance into a crucible
- In the center of the chaos stands a shirtless, flaming man, an Efreeti, alternating between glowering silently and barking terse instructions at his apprentices
In the city of [[Blazing Bekai]], a great furnace is powered by an elemental wish-flame. Customers describe the items they want, and the forge _twists their intent_ into literal form. Run by [[Sahar - Wishsmith]]

- _Hook:_ A jealous apprentice secretly tries to “improve” an order, infusing the weapon with unintended sentience.
