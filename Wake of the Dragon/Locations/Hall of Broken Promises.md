Description:
- XXX

A museum-like vault of unfulfilled wishes — each sealed in crystal orbs that whisper their regret. The djinni scholars study them to “improve” future contracts.

Given the sensitive nature of these unfulfilled wishes, there are numerous high-level magical defenses in place.
- **Sentinel Stone Dragons**
    - Several animated stone drakes (stone golems with draconic features) patrol the vault. They are semi-intelligent and telepathically linked to the bank.
    - Mechanical: use Gargoyle/Stone Golem stats reskinned; CR 5 depending on bank importance. They can shout alarm telepathically if they detect intent to steal (Insight/Perception DC 15 to hide hostile intent).
- **Arcane Time-Lock**
	- Vault door will not open outside scheduled hours; any attempt to force it triggers a time loop that rewinds the last minute (minor nosy time loop) or seals with temporal paralysis.
	- Mechanical: Strength/Thieves’ Tools DC 22 to bypass; otherwise caster must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18) to avoid being frozen for 1d4 rounds.
- **Planar Anchoring Field**
    - Prevents plane-shift, teleportation, and ethereal/astral approaches within the bank. Weaker versions allow short teleports but will be taxed.
    - Mechanical: _Teleportation Circle_ and _Plane Shift_ fail unless caster succeeds on a caster level check (DC 20). _Misty Step_ allowed but leaves signature (Arcana DC 15 to mask).
- **Draconic Wards (Legendbound Runes)**
	- Invisible runes across the vault door and ceiling that react to draconic energy, dragon speech, or draconic blood.
	- Mechanical: when draconic magic/dragon blood/Draconic language is present, the ward pulses (Perception/Arcana DC 15 to notice, Arcana DC 18 to interpret).
- **Aura of Devotion (Ward Against Dragons)**
	- Protective aura that weakens dragon breath and draconic spells within the vault, also repels true dragons unless given a blood tribute.
- **Sympathetic Bonds**
	- Each wish is psychically linked to its originating Djinn. If separated improperly, artifact emits a wail that draws magical guardians.
	- Mechanical: removing artifact without ritual = 3 rounds to contain or a summoned guardian (CR 4–7) appears
