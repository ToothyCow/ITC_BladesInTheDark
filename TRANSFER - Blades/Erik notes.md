I think the addiction vice provides more fertile ground for story building and general skullduggery. The physical deformity will introduce some challenges as well, but more focused on individual scores.

Luke, I appreciate that a core aspect of Blades is that a player character's backstory emerges as the campaign progresses. I will temper my zeal in building out a full backstory for Keel. I don't know enough of the setting to do that anyway!

But, I wanted to throw out a couple of ideas for a little more character context for Keel. Below are a few bullets describing what I think that Keel thinks/knows given his circumstances. 

- Keel's older brother Sten (Skovlan naval officer) was the captain of the last refugee flotilla fleeing Skovlan before the assassination of Aldric and Alayne. 
- The refugee flotilla was attacked by forces aligned to Lord Scurlock. There were no survivors (or so Lord Scurlock believes).
- Keel believes that Scurlock ordered the assassination and destroyed the refugee flotilla to finally destroy the Skovlan royal line. Keel also assumes that he was saved by [[Setarra]] for some purpose related to the eventual reestablishment of the Skovlan royal house, but he is not sure.
- Though it has been over 2 years since the attack on the flotilla, Keel believes that Sten's ghost still "survives" and Keel is driven to find his brother's spirit.

On a separate note, I think Mistress Kember of the Devil's Tooth tavern would be an appropriate vice purveyor.
