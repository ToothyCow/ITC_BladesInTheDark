Grizzled general, gruff, patriotic, conflicted.
Ramrod straight posture, intense gaze, deep growl (Titan Zavala), violent hand gestures

Helped [[Dominus Caius]] take control 80 years ago, led the war against the dragons.

Pros:
- Wants what is best for this nation
- Doubting if Caius is what is actually best
- Passionate about legacy, safety, honor

Pitfalls:
- Hates greed, corruption
- Needs Ariosa to be safe
- Convinced the Dragon Threat is still out there, and hates all dragons
