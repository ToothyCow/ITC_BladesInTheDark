### Special Abilities

**Giant Attributes.** The ogre is resistant to the stunned condition and vulnerable to the prone condition.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The ogre makes two Greatclub or Javelin attacks.

**Greatclub.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

_Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Javelin.** _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target.

_Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

**Bowling Sweep (Recharge 5–6).** The ogre sweeps its weapon in a wide arc. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. Small and smaller creatures have disadvantage on the save.

- On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage, is pushed up to 10 feet away, and is knocked prone.
- On a success, a creature takes half damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone.

### Bonus Actions

**Shoving Rush.** The ogre takes the Dash action. If it moves, it can slam into a creature along its path. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks from a target that fails this save.
