### Special Abilities

- **Cult Tactics:** The monster has advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of the monster's allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally isn't incapacitated.

### Actions

- **Kukri:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Flame Bolt:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) fire damage.
- **Spitfire (Recharge 5-6):** The monster opens its mouth and splashes burning oil in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Channeled Fury:** Two monsters within 5 feet of each other can combine their actions to channel the fury of their patron into a blast that is 5 feet wide and 20 feet long, extending from one of the pair. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone.
