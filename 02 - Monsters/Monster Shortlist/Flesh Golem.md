### Special Abilities

**Aversion to Fire.** If the golem takes fire damage, it loses its immunity to the frightened condition and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

**Berserk (55 HP or Fewer).** When the golem starts its turn, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. While berserk, it attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough, it attacks an object, preferring smaller objects. Once berserk, it continues until destroyed or fully healed.

**Construct Nature.** The golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Flesh Golem Resilience.** The golem is immune to poison damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. It is also immune to exhaustion and the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned conditions.

**Immutable Form.** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Lightning Absorption.** When the golem is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.

**Magic Resistance.** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The golem’s weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The golem makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

_Hit:_ 17 (3d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Creator’s Anguish (Recharge 5–6).** The golem releases a wave of emotional anguish. Each creature within 15 feet must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.

- On a failure, a creature takes 31 (9d6) psychic damage and is **incapacitated** until the end of its next turn, as its mind fills with memories of its greatest failures.
- On a success, a creature takes half damage and isn’t incapacitated.
