# Glance
A guild of legitimate merchants who secretly trade in contraband. Named for their symbol, a golden bee.
TIER IV

# Turf
Many shops, taverns, cafes, warehouses, and other mercantile establishments all across the city. No centralized HQ.

# Members
- Djera Maha (leader, bold, strategic, confident). 
- Karth Orris (mercenary commander, ruthless, insightful, jealous).
- [[Roslyn Kellis]]

# Assets
A massive treasury. Elite mercenaries on retainer. A fleet of transport ships, carriages, wagons, and private trains.

The Hive is known to avoid doing business with any occult or arcane groups. The Church of Ecstasy is popular among Hive members, who reject the superstitions and weird practices of the past.

# Allies
Ministry of Preservation, Dagger Isles Consulate.

# Enemies
The Circle of Flame, The Unseen, The Crows, The Wraiths.

# Situation
Djera Maha grew up as an urchin in the Dagger Isles. She learned all the secrets of vice and smuggling as she worked her way up the ranks of every gang along the trade routes to Doskvol. Having built up her acquisition and distribution network in the city (as well as within the Ministry of Preservation) she is poised to take over all of the contraband markets. Maha had a close relationship (some say romantic) with the leader of the Crows, Roric, who was recently murdered by his second-in-command.

# Plans
- Dominate contraband market: 8
- Avenge Roric’s murder: 6
