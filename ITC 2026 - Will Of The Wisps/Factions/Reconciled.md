# Glance
An association of ancient spirits who have not gone feral with the passage of time.
TIER III

# Turf
None

# Members
The Reconciled have possessed several important citizens in Doskvol. Their exact membership is not known.

*Secret*
- [[Lauria]] ([[Gondoliers]] adept, fast-talker, skittish)

# Assets
Several secret and hidden spirit wells across the city and in the deathlands, which give the Reconciled the arcane energy they need to survive.

# Quirks
The spirits of the Reconciled do not lose their minds or become obsessed with vengeance as other spirits do. They can possess a victim indefinitely without any adverse effects.

# Allies
City Council, [[Gondoliers]].

# Enemies
The Church of Ecstasy, Spirit Wardens, Sparkwrights.

# Situation
The Reconciled are very ancient and wise; they see themselves as the rightful and just rulers that Duskwall needs. A few of the City Council members have become initiates in the Path of Echoes and will soon be vulnerable to possession by the Reconciled. These councilors are also high-ranking members of the Church of the Ecstasy of the Flesh, which will give the Reconciled an opportunity for infiltration into that organization as well.

# Plans
- Infiltrate the City Council: 8
- Infiltrate the Church of Ecstasy: 8
