The canal boat operators. Venerated by ancient tradition. Said to know occult secrets (many things are submerged in the Dusk).
TIER III

# Turf
The canals of Doskvol. Even the Bluecoats’ canal patrol pays respect to them.

# Members
- Eisele (leader, serene, knowledgeable, fearless).
- Griggs (chief Whisper, strange, ruthless, haunted)
- [[Lauria]] (low-rank adept, fast-talker, skittish, spy for the [[Reconciled]])

# Assets
Fleet of gondolas and other water-craft. Map of known spirit wells and arcane sites across the city. A dedicated cohort of Adepts.

# Quirks
Initiation into the Gondoliers grants the Whisper’s Compel special ability.

# Allies
The Lampblacks, Citizenry of all districts.

# Enemies
The Red Sashes, Spirit Wardens.

# Situation
Killers have disposed of bodies in the canals of Doskvol for centuries. The vengeful ghosts that rise from the corpses are a serious threat—a threat dealt with by the Gondoliers since ancient times. Before the Spirit Wardens were created by the Emperor, the Gondoliers protected citizens from rogue spirits and supernatural dangers of all kinds. The Gondoliers are beloved by most citizens, who prefer to go to them with “weird problems” rather that relying on the ruthless and indiscriminate judgment of the Spirit Wardens.

A sudden influx of ritually disfigured hollows dumped in the canals has sparked investigation by the Gondoliers (the Spirit Wardens are pointedly ignoring the situation).

*Secret*
- Are the [[Reconciled]] involved? Or is it the [[Church of Ecstasy]]?

# Plans
- Investigate desecrated hollows: 8
- Destroy spirit wells (repeating): 4
