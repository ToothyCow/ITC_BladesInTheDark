# Glance
Originally a school of ancient Iruvian sword arts, since expanded into criminal endeavors.

# Turf
HQ in their sword-fighting school/temple. Operates a handful of high-end drug dens across Crow’s Foot and the Docks.

# Members
- Mylera Klev (leader, shrewd, ruthless, educated, art collector).

# Assets
Small contingent of master sword-fighters. Master alchemist; many potent potions and essences.

# Quirks
Several members of the Red Sashes are the sons and daughters of Iruvian nobility and diplomats in Doskvol. They train in swordplay at the school and sometimes participate in gang activities. Their families are powerful and will commit significant resources to punishing anyone who harms their children.

# Allies
Iruvian Consulate, The Path of Echoes, Dockers, Cabbies, Inspectors.

# Enemies
The [[Lampblacks]], Bluecoats, [[Gondoliers]].

# Situation
The Red Sashes and the Lampblacks are at war over turf and vengeance for deaths on both sides. Mylera is recruiting every free blade in the district for extra muscle and doesn’t take no for an answer. You’re either with them or against them. The Red Sashes are very well-connected, with former sword students placed at the Iruvian Consulate, in the Path of Echoes, and among the Inspectors.

# Plans
- Destroy the [[Lampblacks]]: 8
- Become ward boss of Crow’s Foot: 8
