# Glance
The former lamp-lighter guild, turned to crime when their services were replaced by electric lights.
TIER II

# Turf
HQ in the office of a coal warehouse. Operates a handful of brothels and cheap drug dens across Crow’s Foot.

# Members
- Bazso Baz (leader, charming, open, ruthless, whiskey connoisseur).
- Pickett (second, shrewd, conniving, suspicious). 
- Henner (thug, loyal, reckless).

# Assets
A fearsome gang of leg-breakers and mayhem-makers. A number of smugglers on the payroll who run their drugs

# Quirks
Bazso Baz is a member of a secret society (forgotten gods cult, “The Empty Vessel”) and sometimes puts the needs of that group ahead of the well-being of his gang.

# Allies 
The Fog Hounds, [[Gondoliers]], Ironhook Prison.

# Enemies
The [[Red Sashes]], The Bluecoats, Cabbies.

# Situation
The Lampblacks and the Red Sashes are at war over turf and vengeance for deaths on both sides. Bazso Baz is recruiting every free blade in the district for extra muscle and doesn’t take no for an answer. You’re either with them or against them. The Lampblacks are not particularly well-connected politically, but are akin to folk-heroes among the working class, who see them as “lovable rogues” standing up to the powers-that-be.

# Plans
- Destroy the Red Sashes: 8
- Become ward boss of Crow’s Foot: 8
