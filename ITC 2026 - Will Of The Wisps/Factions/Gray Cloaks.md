# Glance
A crew of former Bluecoats turned to crime after being framed and expelled from the City Watch.

# Turf
The basement of a burned-down City Watch station (HQ). Several apar
- Operating in [[The Docks]], working with [[Hive]] in proxy war against [[Lord Strangford]]

# Members
- Nessa (leader, scrupulous, daring)
- Hutch (second, brash, fierce)
- [[Artie (Arthur) Donaldson]] (lieutenant, brutal, former detective, Skov)

# Assets
The Gray Cloaks have attracted other former Bluecoats to their crew, amassing a sizeable gang of trained enforcers. They have their old uniforms and badges and often use them to pass as the City Watch.

# Allies
The Inspectors

# Enemies
Bluecoats, Lord Strangford (Leviathan Hunters).

# Situation
The Gray Cloaks are all former Bluecoats who were framed for a crime committed by their Watch station commander. Sure, they were skimming from the city coffers and taking bribes like everyone else, but they didn’t burn down the Watch station and destroy the evidence in the case against Lord Strangford (of the Leviathan Hunters). Several inspectors who were working the case know the truth but can’t prove anything—yet. Lord Strangford would pay well to have these loose ends removed permanently.
