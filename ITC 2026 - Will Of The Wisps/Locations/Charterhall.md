### LANDMARKS
1. [[Charter Wall]]. Along the ruins of the old walls are a sprawl of artist colonies. Bohemian lovers of music and sculpture, these students are typically patronized by a single individual or family who expect their charges to master their craft and make art for their edification.
2. [[Bellweather Crematorium]]. The site of the spirit bells and the rookery for the deathseeker crows. Bodies recovered by the Spirit Wardens are incinerated in electroplasm here to destroy their ghosts.
3. [[Clerk Street]]. The main avenue of the district is lined with imposing governmental structures of all sorts, tucked behind iron fences, patrolled by a mix of Bluecoats on the sidewalks and mounted Imperial cavalry on the grounds.
4. [[Jayan Park]]. The great alchemist for whom this park is named contrived to formulate soil and seeds that could produce real, growing trees, without sunlight or radiant energy. They are horrifically toxic to all living things and must not be touched, but they still grow beautifully here, over 100 years later.
5. [[Charterhall University]]. A dozen buildings have been converted into classrooms and dormitories for the students of this modest-seeming but nevertheless prestigious institution. The school's massive Sparkwright Tower, where experts of spark-craft are trained, looms huge over the district, often belching fire and smoke from the more vigorous lessons.
