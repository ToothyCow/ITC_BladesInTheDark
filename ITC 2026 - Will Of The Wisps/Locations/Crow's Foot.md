# LANDMARKS
1. Crow’s Nest. An ancient tower from before the cataclysm that has been a ritual sanctum, an astronomer’s laboratory, and a Bluecoat watch post—before its current role as the headquarters of the district’s chief gang, the Crows.
2. Tangletown. Hundreds of years ago, one of the massive leviathan hunter ships was partially sunk in the river. Since then, it’s collected an attendant flotilla of tiny watercraft, all lashed together into a floating neighborhood. Tangletown is considered neutral ground among the street gangs of Crow’s Foot, and no violence is allowed there.
3. Strathmill House. The lost children and unwanted orphans of Crow’s Foot inevitably pass through the halls of Strathmill House. Some are cared for and trained for jobs at the docks or the workhouses of Coalridge. Others are quietly instructed in the arts of the lookouts and runners used by the gangs of the district—all for a small fee to Strathmill House, of course.
4. Red Sash Sword Academy. This large mansion has been converted into a training school for the Falling Star style of Iruvian sword play. The Red Sashes, an Iruvian gang who run several luxury drug dens in the district, claim it as their HQ and cover operation for their illicit operations.
