# Recap
- [[Session 0]]

OVERALL
- You are a new crew of Shadows in a haunted Victorian city, surrounded by the desperate and the dead

# Strong Start
- We start in [[Charterhall]], a well-to-do district of Duskvol
	- Clerks and government workers rush to and fro, official papers bulging from their valises. Wealthy bankers trundle past in heavy carriages with private bodyguards arrayed in clanking armor. At street-corner cafes, students gather to discuss Iruvian politics, the tribal lineages of the Dagger Isles, and other esoteric matters. To the south, [[Jayan Park]] emanates a gentle, inviting glow from its beautiful, magical, horrifically toxic trees, while in the north the death crows circle ominously over [[Bellweather Crematorium]]. Try to ignore the death bells.
- We zoom in on a modest shopfront, nestled up against the Charter Wall surrounded by small communities of artists and scholars.
	- What's the name of the business, and what does it sell?
- We follow an elegantly dressed noblewoman as she enters the shop, greets the desk clerk warmly, then slips into the back and upstairs to a into a hidden room in the back.
	- Can each of you describe one notable detail about your secret base, and introduce your character?
- Score: [[Steal the Crows' War Treasury]]

# Questions and Complications
- How are the Skov refugees affected by the war in Crow's Foot?
- What is the Gray Cloak's plan? Why were they ousted from the force?
- What ritual is needed to stabilize a ghost?
