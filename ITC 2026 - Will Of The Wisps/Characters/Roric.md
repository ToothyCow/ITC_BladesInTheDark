### Gang boss, deal maker, high roller, ghost
- Stoic, deep voice (Zavala)
- Elbow on the table, confidently leaning in
- Growly "Hmm..."
- Ghost - tends to trail off, repeat thoughts as echoes, fall back to replaying bits of his life rather than saying something new. Has to strain to say something he hasn't heard before
*Background*

Opportunities:
- Hates [[Lyssa]], wants revenge
- Close to a way to stabilize his spirit, but his contact with the [[Gondoliers]] - [[Lauria]] - held out some crucial parts of the process

Pitfalls:
- Appealing to justice or his "better nature". That's not how the world works
