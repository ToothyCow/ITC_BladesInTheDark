Luke, I went ahead and bought the full Blades digital pack. Was only $20. Well worth it.

I have been doing more reading about the game and thinking about my character. I wanted to bounce a couple ideas off you.

First, I found the portion on vice enlightening, particularly the line - "The effectiveness of your indulgence depends upon your character’s worst attribute rating. It’s their weakest quality (Insight, Prowess, or Resolve) that is most in thrall to vice." For my character, the worst attribute will be Prowess, so I thought it might be interesting to have a vice more related to physical aspects like pleasure or stupor. Which led me to the potential that my character is a drug addict, seeking a stupor type drug like heroin to seek oblivion from the haunting voices and physical pain.

Second, this potential physical limitation angle led me to explore whether my character could be physically handicapped. Perhaps he has a deformed leg which causes severe discomfort and requires my character to use a cane which could serve as an unusual weapon. He can walk and can force a quiet stalking for a brief period at increased pain, but his right leg is moderately deformed. He could have been deformed at birth which fostered his studies in the arcane.

I couldn't help but think about the Dr. House character on the House TV show with this angle on my character.

Luke, I appreciate that a core aspect of Blades is that a player character's backstory emerges as the campaign progresses. I will temper my zeal in building out a full backstory for Keel. I don't know enough of the setting to do that anyway!

But, I wanted to throw out a couple of ideas for a little more character context for Keel. Below are a few bullets describing what I think that Keel thinks/knows given his circumstances. 

- Keel's older brother Sten (Skovlan naval officer) was the captain of the last refugee flotilla fleeing Skovlan before the assassination of Aldric and Alayne. 
- The refugee flotilla was attacked by forces aligned to Lord Scurlock. There were no survivors (or so Lord Scurlock believes).
- Keel believes that Scurlock ordered the assassination and destroyed the refugee flotilla to finally destroy the Skovlan royal line. Keel also assumes that he was saved by Setarra for some purpose related to the eventual reestablishment of the Skovlan royal house, but he is not sure.
- Though it has been over 2 years since the attack on the flotilla, Keel believes that Sten's ghost still "survives" and Keel is driven to find his brother's spirit.

On a separate note, I think Mistress Kember of the Devil's Tooth tavern would be an appropriate vice purveyor.
