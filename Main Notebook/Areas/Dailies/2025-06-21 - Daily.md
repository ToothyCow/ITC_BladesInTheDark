# Thoughts
- Why does planning like this stress me out? What am I feeling?
	- I'm missing something
	- I'm going to mess it up
	- I'm not dependable, reliable, or smart
	- I shouldn't be in charge
- What does God say to me?
	- I am with you
	- I will strengthen you and equip you to care for your family
	- You are doing fine. Keep trusting me, and keep growing in wisdom and trust.
