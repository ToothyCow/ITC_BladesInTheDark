Feeling - viciously frustrated at Danika for being so impatient and short with me. I'm as tired as she is, and I'm trying so hard to be present and intentional, and she just keeps complaining and complaining, and harping on every failure and frustration with me. I want her to shut up and think for a few seconds about how I'm feeling, but instead she just keeps venting her feelings on me. I am so frustrated and tired, and it makes me feel like I shouldn't even bother trying to be intentional if my best efforts can't keep my baby happy or my wife content. What am I doing? Why am I living a life that is so draining and depressing? How can I speak up in a way that builds up instead of tearing down? Voicing my frustrations at all feels like an attack. I feel like I need a good cry, but I don't know what to cry about. I feel like I need to punch a wall, but I don't want to damage the B&B.

God, I know that Danika is just as tired, sick, and frustrated as I am. I know she is not intentionally taking her frustrations out on me. I know that I love her and that I don't regret marrying her. Still, my emotions are running hot and strong, and I don't know what to do about it. Please give me patience, wisdom, and peace. Help me to deal with these feelings healthily, and practice loving Danika and Flora well.
