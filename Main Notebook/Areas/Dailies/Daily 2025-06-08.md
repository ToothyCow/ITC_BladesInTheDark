# Feeling
Tired, on edge. Feels like Danika has been on a hair trigger, and I'm fluctuating between walking on eggshells and trying to be OK with her being mad at me, all while Flora is sick, fussy, and vomiting. My attention is always needed on 3 things at once, and I am so tired.

Sad that I'm feeling so drained. I feel weak, incapable of emotionally weathering stressful times. Am I equipped to handle the demands of adult life? If so, why do I feel so overwhelmed?

# Gratitude
- I am grateful that I am done with the AETC Student Ops COP contract
- I am grateful that I have a loving wife and daughter
- I am grateful to have the resources and time to go on vacation
- I am grateful for the opportunity to play D&D with friends and family 
- I am grateful for God and the peace He offers
- I am grateful that I can be patient and kind to Flora while she is feeling bad
- I am grateful I can find ways to love Danika while she is feeling overwhelmed and anxious


# What Do I Need To Do
- Prep D&D and Starfinder one-shot
	- Make characters and send to players
	- Finish scene prep - pictures, music, NPCs, conflicts
	- Find PF2e monsters to reskin as robots
