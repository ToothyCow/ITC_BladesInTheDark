Jeremiah 20:7 NIV

[7] You deceived me, Lord, and I was deceived; you overpowered me and prevailed. I am ridiculed all day long; everyone mocks me.

Jeremiah's honesty here is startling. I would be afraid to even think this, let alone pray it or write it down. Jeremiah seems to know that God can handle his feelings, and isn't afraid to express them.
