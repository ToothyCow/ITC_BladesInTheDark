The leaders of Israel are such interesting cases here. First, we have Zedekiah, being dragged around by the opinions of those under him. He is a slave to the whims of the people, and is too afraid of them to do what is right, even if it would save him, his family, and countless others who live in the city. 

Then, we have Gedaliah, refusing to acknowledge the danger of an ambitious man, ignoring the wise counsel around him. Did he not think that Ishmael was a threat, or did he think he was strong enough to defend himself when he was actually vulnerable? 

Finally, we have Ishmael, so determined to take control in this violence and chaotic time that he murders over a hundred people, all to become the sad little king of a broken people. 

Lord, when You put me in a position of leadership, let me be wise, caring, and motivated, and protect me from the extremes shown in this passage.
