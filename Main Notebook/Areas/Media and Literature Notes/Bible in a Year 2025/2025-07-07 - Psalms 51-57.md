Psalms 57:4-5 NLT

[4] I am surrounded by fierce lions who greedily devour human prey— whose teeth pierce like spears and arrows, and whose tongues cut like swords. [5] Be exalted, O God, above the highest heavens! May your glory shine over all the earth.

It is amazing to me that in the midst of David being attacked and hounded, he still aims to exalt God. He is not just calling out for help, but is instead elevating God above himself! Lord, give me that kind of perspective on what truly matters.
