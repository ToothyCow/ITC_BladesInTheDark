It's incredibly sad to see the remnant of Judah get it so wrong here. They started so well, asking Jeremiah for a word from God and promising to follow. How did they shift so fast? It seemed like the turning point came when God asked them to do something counterintuitive and rely on His protection. In their minds, God had just allowed their city to be overthrown - why would they trust Him again? They didn't remember the full story, and they didn't know who God really was. Because of this, they attributed good things from God to false idols, and rejected Him altogether.

Despite all this, Jeremiah goes with them, and continues to speak God's word to the people, warning them of the dangers and inviting them to come back. Lord, thank you for remembering mercy, even in the most justified of judgments!
