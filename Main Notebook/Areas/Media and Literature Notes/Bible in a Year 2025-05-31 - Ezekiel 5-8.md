Ezekiel 8 is a truly chilling depiction of just how deep the corruption in Israel has gone. Some people are doing sin out in the open, while others are hiding it away. God sees it all, and condemns their vile actions.

The previous chapters talked about how parents would eat their children and children eat their parents. A thought struck me - did God make these people do these things? No. God is stirring up warfare and strife, and these people are reacting selfishly, violently, and cruelly. We all like to think we would be heroes under stress, but the people of Israel at this time were corrupt and twisted by idol worship and injustice. The hard times just stripped the veneer away.

Lord, let me align myself with You and follow Your ways. Turn my heart to You in good times, so I will be ready for hard times.
