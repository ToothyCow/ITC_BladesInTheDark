# Prologue
- People think negotiation is all about logic, tactics, and assertiveness. Instead, it's as much about emotion as it is about logic. 
- Active listening is absolutely key. When other people feel heard and seen, they become more willing to discuss. 
- Slow things down, ask questions, speak calmly and quietly.

# Ch 2
- Late-night DJ Voice - slow, low, in control.
- Inflect down to assert statements of fact.
- Mirroring intentionally - repeating a few words back to connect and actively listen
- Never phrase a statement as a question when you don't want a negative response. Instead of "I can't do that. How about this?", just leave it at "I can't do that."
- Never underestimate silence. Take a beat, slow it down, be in control. Don't answer aggression with aggression or anxiety. Take control of your own emotions.
- Assumptions will hurt your critical thinking. Hypotheses will help it.
- Negotiation is not a battle. It is discovery of information.
- To silence the voice in your head getting in the way of negotiation, make your so soul and all-consuming purpose to listen and understand.

# Ch. 3
- Don't feel their pain. Label it.
- Emotions are one of the primary derailers of conversation and negotiation. However, they don't have to be obstacles - they can be means to understanding and change.
- Empathy Is not feeling what they are feeling - that is sympathy. Empathy is just understanding what someone else is feeling, and what is behind those feelings.
- Labeling an emotion reduces your own emotional reaction to the emotion and moves you into more rational, objective thinking.
- Use "It sounds like", "it seems like", or "it looks like" when labeling. Keeps it objective and non-judgmental. You can walk it back with "I'm not saying that's what you're feeling. I'm saying that's how it looks."
- After labeling, be silent. Let the label do its work, and let the other party fill in the blanks.
- Accusation Audit - List and address their worst criticisms, acknowledge and label them. Helps people feel seen, understood.

# Ch. 4
- "No" is the beginning of negotiation. Don't be afraid! 
- 3 types of yes - counterfeit, confirmation, commitment
- When you're talking with someone and think you're helping them, but they end up thanking you for doing a good job, that might be a sign you were too assertive. A gentle touch ends with them taking ownership, maybe even congratulating themselves. When you're listening, is it about you and your ego, or actually helping?
- IIn email, this can be particularly powerful. Start your email with something like "have you given up on this contract?" Or "have we satisfied all your needs?" This provokes a response

# Ch. 5
- "That's Right" Is better than "Yes"
- Trigger using summary and paraphrase. Rearticulate and reaffirm "the world according to X"

# Ch. 6
- Influencing emotions = shifting perceived reality
- Anchoring - human tendency to subconsciously shift what is considered reasonable in response to an extreme value. Can be lower or higher
- "Fair" is an emotional word often used to manipulate. When used against you, ask the other party to explain the unfairness.
- Whenever possible, emphasize loss aversion.
- Consider the emotional reality of what you are selling/buying

# Ch. 7
- "He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has learned the greatest secret of negotiation". - Quote
- Calibrated question - open-ended question that suspends disbelief/antagonism to focus on solution
	- How am I supposed to do that?

# Ch. 8
- Any decision you reach needs to be able to be implemented. Yes is useless without how and when
- Rule of 3 - get them to agree to something 3 times in the same conversation.
	- Initial commitment
	- Restatement/summary leading to "That's right"
	- calibrated question like "What will we do if we get off track?"
- Keep an eye out for deal-breakers behind the table. Ask "How does your team feel about this?" and "How will this affect the rest of your company?" will show signs.
- Watch for pronouns.
	- Lots of I, me, my - likely someone without the power to make decisions
	- Lots of we, our, us - likely someone who can make decisions
	- Lots of third-person, distant pronouns - could be lying

# Ch. 9
Ackerman method:
- determine your desired Target value 
- starts at 65% of that 
- set thresholds at 85%, 95%, and 100% for concessions. 95 and 100 should be non-round numbers
- after providing the initial low value to anchor, use calibrated questions, gentle no's, and silence to get multiple counter offers before going to the next threshold

# Ch. 10
- Deep listening gives access to Black Swans, info that fundamentally shifts the negotiation. Learning these gives you leverage.
	- Negative leverage - threats. Use sparingly and gently. Paradox of power states that the harder you push, the harder people push back
	- Normative leverage - sense of fairness and normalcy. People don't generally like to be outsiders and weirdos.
	- Positive leverage - benefits. Emphasize what you're offering
- Understand their religion - if you can figure out what makes someone tick, you understand their norms, and have greater normative leverage
- If You're going to be great at anything, you need to be comfortable handling conflict without getting upset. Remember that the adversary is the conflict itself, and your negotiating partner is actually your partner
