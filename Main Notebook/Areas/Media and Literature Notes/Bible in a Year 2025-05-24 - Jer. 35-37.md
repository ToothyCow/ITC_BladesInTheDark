I am struck by the king's callous disregard for Jeremiah's prophecy, intentionally listening to it just to cut it up and throw it in the fire. It must have felt so devastating to have worked so hard to get that message to the people in power, only to have your message not just ignored, but actively mocked. Despite this, Jeremiah just kept going, continuing to speak God's word to a disobedient and willfully ignorant nation. Lord, give me the dedication to keep going in this kind of discouragement!
