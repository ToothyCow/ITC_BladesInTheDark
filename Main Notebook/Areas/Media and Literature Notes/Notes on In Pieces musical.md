Fork in the Road
- The writing is incredible - loving the evocative wordplay.

You Never Know
- Catchiest hook I've heard in ages
- The key change hits like a sledgehammer

Me and Mr. Popularity
- Cute, clever writing
- Establishes characters quickly

Bloom
- Not my favorite, but cute
- Sets up Get Up and Go incredibly

Caffeinated 
- Very different vibe, weirdly reminds me of In The Heights a little bit
- The change in the singer's perspective on her role is really cool

A Classroom Duet

Love Wildly

Me and Mr. Popularity (Reprise)
- Great use of reprise - the anxiety and uncertainty is back with a fury here, and it's great

Get Up and Go
- This song is incredible
- "4 years, 7 months, and 2 weeks, but who's counting? Not me" - so good
- The part where it shifts to 3/4 time with a waltz-style tune? Amazing! Vulnerability and sadness break through
- Reference back to bloom is so good. Is it the same couple, or a different couple meant for juxtaposing?

Ohio
- Really catchy
- Wait, are they both from Ohio, or is this a metaphor based off of non-song dialogue?

This Is Not Me
- Getting some Sondheim vibes. Am I crazy?
- Great emotion, but I wanna know the context so bad

Like You Don't Miss Me
- This song is ***fire***
- Straight up great pop song

Another New York Love Story
- Very different vibe, reminds me of Caffeinated earlier. Is this the same girl? I hope so - I want her to find love after that song
- The countdown of stops starting as her wanting to leave and ending with her dreading leaving is so cool
- "You kiss my cheek and I'm home" - AAAAAAAA my heart

Love Me, Love Me Not
- Beautiful (potentially?) unrequited love song
- Weirdly good fit for God speaking to His people

Singin' the Same Line
