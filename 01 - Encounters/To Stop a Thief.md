# Setup:
- Guarding the [[Hall of Broken Promises]] against [[Seekers of the Flame]]
	- Rumored to try to steal an incomplete wish
- Seekers planning to implement a Dimensional Swap
	- Instead of breaking the vault, the cultists create a _mirror vault_ — a one-time planar pocket or demiplane that duplicates the bank interior. They swap the real artifacts with convincing fakes made of binding illusions and animate constructs; then they lure the bank guardians into the fake vault using a summoned draconic spirit and remove the real artifacts through the pocket.
	- Beats: Bypass scrying by creating a duplicate echo signature (Arcana DC 20 to craft), fight or distract sentinel dragons while extraction occurs, then fold the demiplane and exit through a hidden anchor point.
