# General Vibes
Act 1: Subtle strangeness → investigation and magical diagnosis.

Act 2: Realization → a race against time to stabilize the vault or stop the ritual.

Act 3: Mirror breach → fight amidst reality tearing, illusions, double enemies, and artifact hazards.

Act 4: Fallout → vault saved (barely), cultists escape (maybe), bank owes the players big… or some artifacts are now missing, hinting at a sequel.

# Setup:
- Guarding the [[Hall of Broken Promises]] against [[Seekers of the Flame]]
	- Rumored to try to steal an incomplete wish
- Seekers planning to implement a Dimensional Swap
	- Instead of breaking the vault, the cultists create a _mirror vault_ — a one-time planar pocket or demiplane that duplicates the bank interior. They swap the real artifacts with convincing fakes made of binding illusions and animate constructs; then they lure the bank guardians into the fake vault using a summoned draconic spirit and remove the real artifacts through the pocket.
	- Beats: Bypass scrying by creating a duplicate echo signature (Arcana DC 20 to craft), fight or distract sentinel dragons while extraction occurs, then fold the demiplane and exit through a hidden anchor point.

## The “Tells” — signs that the Mirror Vault attack is underway


### Subtle Anomalies


| Sign | What it looks like | Mechanical hook | 
| ------ | --- | ---- |
| Echo Lag	| The bank’s Echo Locks show slightly desynced reflections — a half-second delay between movement and reflection.	| Arcana (DC 15) or Perception (DC 18) detects the delay. A critical success might reveal that reflections show different gestures entirely.|
| Sound Phasing	| Footsteps or spoken words echo with faint double-voices. |	Insight (DC 14) or Investigation (DC 15) identifies planar resonance. |
| Temperature Mirage	| The air grows subtly cooler or wavers with heat like desert mirage lines around the vault.	| Arcana (DC 17) reveals extra-dimensional interference. |
| Duplicated Objects	| Coins or ledgers appear twice — one is solid, one an illusion.	| Investigation (DC 15) to notice mismatched shadows or reflection angles. |
| Guardian Confusion	| Stone Dragon Sentinels occasionally stop mid-patrol or attack empty air.	| Animal Handling (DC 16) or Insight (DC 15) to realize they sense something “phased.” |


### Magical Warnings

| Sign	| What happens	| Mechanical hook |
| --------| ------ | ------ |
| Scrying Distortion	| The Scrying Lattice returns flickering double-images of the vault.	| Arcana (DC 18) check reveals the distortion matches planar displacement signatures.|
| Planar Alarm Glitch	| The Planar Anchoring Field pings an anomaly but doesn’t pinpoint it.	| Arcana (DC 20) or Religion (DC 16) might triangulate the unstable locus. |
| Archivist Spirit Stutter	| One of the bank’s ghostly curators repeats the same phrase, or references “two vaults.”	| Insight or Persuasion DC 14–17 to coax more information. |
| Artifact Unease	| A relic begins to vibrate, glow, or hum — it's reacting to its duplicate’s creation.	| Arcana DC 18 to realize it’s being sympathetically mirrored. |


### NPC / Environmental Red Flags
- A junior archivist (cultist) requests unusual access to calibration rituals.
- Magical drafts swirl inward toward the vault, not outward.
- The light of continual flame torches flickers between two colors.

## Heist Begins
A rip in space appears in the vault, with a massive dragon roaring in the center. 

All the stone guardians dive forward to intercept, only for the rip to close behind them. In its place stands a lone man with scarred skin, appearing burned. Seeing you, he starts, then a slow smile spreads over his face. "You are not my mission, but I am so glad you chose to get in my way." His skin splits and shreds, like a snake shedding its skin, as the red dragon unfurls to its full size. Despite being a wyrmling, freshly transformed, it's still massive, about 7 feet tall at the shoulder and with a 15 foot wingspan.

As he stands tall and bellows a laughing challenge, though, the runes within the vault glow bright and lash onto him. He growls and struggles, pulling away from the bonds, but it's clear these runes are slowing him down.
