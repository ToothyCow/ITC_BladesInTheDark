Set the stage:
- You are brought to a doorway labeled "Main Hall - Guest Entrance". A fairy with a magical tablet says "You are live in 3, 2, 1..." and opens the door. "Announcing the Champions of Lesa, mortal guests of her majesty the Queen of the Starry Host."
- A lavish feast is laid upon a long dining table made of branches and bushes, cultivated and grown to be perfectly ornate
- Fairies of all types were lounging, eating, and laughing before the announcement, but as soon as you were announced, all conversation died, and all eyes are fixed on you
- At the head of the table, the Queen sits upon a stark black throne of uncertain material, lights glittering in its depths. She holds a scepter casually in one hand.
- To her left, Kanto kneels in chains, a desperate expression on his face.

Incentives:
- Reclaim her peoples’ land and story
- Get revenge on the Raven's Guild
- SECRET: Save her son's life

Conflicts:
- Needs to appear strong to her people
- Feels insulted by the mortals’ stealing her land
- SECRET: Mortals are usurping her story

Limitations: 
- Can't fully acknowledge the Dreamers
- Needs to keep the drama up

Moments:
- "Ah! The Champions have arrived. Are you here to raze more of my beloved forest to the ground?"
- "My current impression of your city and its leaders are thoughtless destruction and callous disregard for nature in all its forms. Why should I believe that you would change your tune in the future?"
- Kanto is to be punished severely for this and previous failures. Retaking Lesa was his last chance to prove himself.
- If the party advocates for Kanto:
	- "Very well, we will remit him into your care. First, though, the rites must be observed. Kanto, come to me."
	- Kanto steps forward, shoulders slumped, utterly defeated. "My queen, please... I can make this work."
	- The queen pulls up the hood of his cloak, caresses his face for a moment, then grabs and pulls.
	- Kanto's face comes back in her hand, a delicate wooden mask. As she holds it aloft, it bursts into flames. Kanto's face is left in shadow, impossible to make out.
	- "Kanto's story ends here. My son, may you forge a new name and a better story next time."
